The Advanced Placement Psychology (also known as AP Psychology or AP Psych) course and corresponding exam are part of College Board's Advanced Placement Program. This course is tailored for students interested in the field of psychology and as an opportunity to earn Advanced Placement credit or exemption from a college-level psychology course.
