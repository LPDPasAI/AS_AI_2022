The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron, the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2016. The car is based on the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car.
The car is named after the Monégasque driver Louis Chiron. The car shares the name with the 1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car.
In January 2022 it was announced that every Chiron had been sold. As of January 2022, some of these sold vehicles still need to be physically manufactured and delivered to their owners.


  Specifications and performance  

The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.
The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS) less power.Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system. The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.The Chiron can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375–380 km/h (233–236 mph) without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as Bugatti concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving. Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily attain its limited top speed. Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg‑imp; 10.45 mpg‑US).


  Sales  
The first 200 cars were sold before the first was delivered. The base price is €2,400,000 and buyers were required to place a €200,000 deposit before their purchase.


  Variants  


  Chiron Sport (2018)  

At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, Bugatti unveiled the track focused version of the Chiron, named the Chiron Sport. Mechanically the car is identical to the regular version, generating 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) from a quad-turbocharged W16 engine but is 18 kg (40 lb) lighter due to the extensive use of carbon fibre and has a stiffer suspension in order to increase the cornering ability of the car while maintaining its grand touring characteristics. The steering of the car has also received modifications and a torque vectoring system to control the power sent to each wheel of the car for improved handling in tight corners has been added. Aerodynamic improvements and light weight have been given special consideration in order to keep the car competitive on the race track. The Chiron Sport became available in late 2018 for an additional US$400,000 on the standard Chiron.


   110 Ans Bugatti (2019)   

Introduced in February 2019, the 110 Ans Bugatti is a limited edition variant of the Chiron Sport developed to celebrate 110 years of Bugatti. The car features carbon fibre bodywork finished in matte Steel Blue exterior colour. The body is also accented with Steel Blue bare carbon fibre. The exhaust system of the car is finished in matte black colour.
The colours of the French flag are present on the wing mirrors, fuel filler cap and on the underside of the rear wing. The brake calipers are finished in blue colour.
The interior of the car is upholstered in blue Alcantara and also has the colours of the French flag present on the headrests of the seats, on the back of the seats and on top of the steering wheel. Production will be limited to 20 units.


   Les Légendes du Ciel (2020)   

Introduced in November 2020, the "Les Légendes du Ciel" Chiron is a limited edition version of the Chiron Sport developed to celebrate Bugatti's racing drivers that flew in the French Air Force.
The car features a new grill, a French flag behind the front wheels, a matte grey ("Gris Serpent") exterior colour with a gloss white stripe in the centre.
The interior is upholstered in tan leather and turned aluminium.

Production will be limited to 20 units at €2.88 million each.


  Chiron Super Sport 300+ (2019) /  Chiron Super Sport 300 (2021)  

On 2 August 2019 Bugatti presented a limited production high performance variant of the Chiron called the Chiron Super Sport to owners taking part in the company's 110th-anniversary tour in Europe. The variant is limited to 30 examples and closely resembles the prototype performing the top speed record run. Changes from the standard Chiron include a more powerful engine, increased top speed, and a characteristic paint scheme featuring a lacquer-coated carbon fibre body with orange stripes, echoing the aesthetics of the company's previous top speed record-breaking cars, the Veyron Super Sport World Record Edition and the Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse World Record Car.
The car is powered by a 1,175 kW (1,580 hp; 1,600 PS) quad-turbocharged W16 engine shared with the Bugatti Centodieci, nicknamed "Thor". This car has a grey Bugatti logo made of black enamel and silver, the exhaust system from the Centodieci, a modified gearbox with longer ratios and front and rear bumpers optimised for aerodynamics at high speed, resulting in the overall length increase of the car by 248.9 mm (9.8 in).
The Super Sport 300+ will also be equipped with a top speed limiter, akin to the one found in the standard Chiron. Without the limiter, Bugatti claims that the car can attain a maximum speed in excess of 483 km/h (300 mph). Bugatti will also prepare the cars of owners who want to take the car to its full potential at the Ehra-Lessien test track.


  Chiron Super Sport (2022)  

The standard version of the 300+ world record car. Unlike the 300+, it does not come with interior stiffening and has more leather in the interior like a typical Bugatti Chiron. More visual differences include special redesigned wheels and a paint finish instead of the bare carbon fibre seen in the 300+. The Chiron Super Sport will have the same power output as the 300+ but will be limited to 440 km/h (273 mph). It also has the capability to accelerate from 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 5.8 seconds and from 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 12.1 seconds. Unlike the 300+, the limiter cannot be disabled by Bugatti in the Super Sport for prepared runs. Production will start in early 2022. This is the next generation supercar of the Bugatti Super Sport series present in Veyron and EB110 series cars. 


  Chiron Pur Sport (2020)  

On 3 March 2020, Bugatti introduced the Chiron Pur Sport, a handling-focused model which will be limited to 60 units. The tachometer has an additional 200 rpm, increasing the redline to 6,900 rpm. 80 percent of the transmission has been revised for a 15 percent closer gear-ratio spread benefiting the power band. The Pur Sport is 50 kg (110 lb) lighter than the standard Chiron due to a lightweight 3D printed titanium exhaust, a fixed rear spoiler and extensive use of Alcantara, anodised aluminium and titanium on the interior. The wheels have special spokes called "aero blades" which are designed to channel turbulent air near the wheel down the side of the vehicle to the rear diffuser. The tyres are Michelin Sport Cup 2R increasing lateral grip by 10 percent, and were co-developed with Michelin. To improve handling, the springs were made 65 percent stiffer at the front and 33 percent at the rear, aided by revised damper tuning and wheel camber along with additional front and rear carbon-fibre anti-roll bars and a new Sport+ drive mode. Production of the Pur Sport is expected to start in late 2020.


  Chiron Noire (2020)  
Bugatti announced a special-edition, the Chiron Noire, celebrating the 1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Coupé Aero No. 57453 (also known as "La Voiture Noire") following the 2019 one-off homage and namesake "La Voiture Noire". The special edition comes in two versions, the Noire Élégance (black exposed carbon body) and the Noire Sportive (black exposed carbon body covered with a matte black finish). Only 20 will be made. The Noire starts at around $3.3 million, and deliveries are expected to begin in mid-2020. The Chiron Noire package is available for the entry-level Chiron or the Chiron Sport, in this case at an extra charge of €100,000.


  Bugatti La Voiture Noire  

The La Voiture Noire is a one-off special introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. Based on the Chiron, the design of the car harkens back to the Type 57 SC Atlantic and is a celebration of the company's distinctive design history. The car has a hand-built body made from carbon fibre designed by Bugatti designer Etienne Salomé which has an elongated nose (similar to that on the Divo) and an elongated rear section. Other notable features include unique wing mirrors, LED taillight strip, and wheels. Unlike the original, the car retains the mid-engine layout.
A trim piece running from the front of the car to the rear spoiler recalls the dorsal fin present on the Type 57 SC. The car features a floating windscreen and has masked A-pillars. The La Voiture Noire's shares large design similarities from the Bugatti Rembrandt, a cancelled front-engine grand tourer powered by the Chiron's W16 engine.The La Voiture Noire will be powered by the same 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged W16 engine from the Chiron having the same power output figures but the 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox and the all-wheel-drive system are heavily revised in order to allow for a more relaxed driving experience. Softer dampers and a revised chassis contribute to the factor. The car features six exhaust pipes recalling the innovative design of the past.
Performance figures remain unknown but the company states that the car is likely to have a lower top speed and acceleration times as compared to the Chiron due to its Grand Touring nature. The car was sold for a price of $18.68 million, making it one of the most expensive cars built to date.A statement made later by the company confirmed that the car on display was a concept car and that the final product would take two and a half years more to complete. The show car had electric motors instead of an engine for easy maneuverability.


  Records  


  Acceleration and braking record  

At the 2017 IAA show in Frankfurt, Bugatti announced that the Chiron broke the record of fastest 0–400–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) acceleration time, completing it in 41.96 seconds in a span of 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) at the Ehra-Lessien high-speed oval. The car was driven by Colombian racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya.Bugatti also added an extra livery to the Chiron on display to confirm that it was the same car that broke the 0–400–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) record. During the show, Bugatti also mentioned that during the run, the car accelerated from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.1 seconds, 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.1 seconds, and 0–400 km/h (0–248.5 mph) in 32.6 seconds, which altogether, also makes the Chiron faster than its predecessor, the Veyron.


  Top speed achievement  
On 2 August 2019, Bugatti test driver Andy Wallace achieved a speed of 490.48 km/h (304.77 mph) in a pre-production Chiron Super Sport 300+ prototype at Volkswagen's test facility in Ehra-Lessien. The speed was verified by the TÜV, Germany's Technical Inspection Association. This speed was not achieved using a production model. In its final, road-legal production form, the Chiron SS 300+ has a limited top speed of 436 km/h (271 mph). 
The car was developed under Bugatti head exterior designer Frank Heyl in collaboration with Italian automobile engineering firm Dallara and tyre manufacturer Michelin over the course of six months. The overall length of the car was increased by 248.9 mm (9.8 in) and it is fitted by a laser-controlled ride height system in order to reduce drag. To further reduce drag and aid aerodynamics, the electronically controlled rear wing was removed and was replaced with a long tail incorporating a rear wing with a short cross-section. A full roll cage was added for safety reasons, and the passenger seat was removed to make way for data recording equipment used to validate the record run. The car incorporates an exhaust system first introduced on the Bugatti Centodieci in order to further reduce aerodynamic drag. Mechanically, the engine was modified to generate 1,177 kW (1,578 hp; 1,600 PS) of power output with no changes to the gearbox and all-wheel-drive system.
