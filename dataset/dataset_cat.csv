"As part of the reduction in BBC Online's budget of 25%, all non-essential services that did not focus around core products were closedAs all posts had to be post moderated and as conversations were increasingly being done through social media websites that BBC Sport were a part of, the site was closed on 31 May 2011    Interactive services    BBC Sport also offers a service on the BBC Red Button interactive television service",0
"The service offers a sports multi-screen service covering sports news stories in addition to five streams that can broadcast sport through the red buttonThis is often used for uninterrupted coverage and scores over a commentary, or for an alternative sport event unable to be covered on the main BBC TV or radio servicesA key example is of the broadcasts of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships as matches on other courts may be displayed through the red button while a higher ranking match on a main court is taking place on the main TV service",0

"The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.SThe successor to the Bugatti Veyron, the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2016The car is based on the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept carThe car is named after the Monégasque driver Louis Chiron",0
"The car shares the name with the 1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept carIn January 2022 it was announced that every Chiron had been soldAs of January 2022, some of these sold vehicles still need to be physically manufactured and delivered to their owners    Specifications and performance    The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily updatedThe engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm",0
"The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS) less power.Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive systemThe carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.The Chiron can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds",0
"In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375–380 km/h (233–236 mph) without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as Bugatti concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving",0
"Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily attain its limited top speedMixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg‑imp; 10.45 mpg‑US)    Sales   The first 200 cars were sold before the first was deliveredThe base price is €2,400,000 and buyers were required to place a €200,000 deposit before their purchase    Variants       Chiron Sport (2018)    At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, Bugatti unveiled the track focused version of the Chiron, named the Chiron Sport",0
"Mechanically the car is identical to the regular version, generating 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) from a quad-turbocharged W16 engine but is 18 kg (40 lb) lighter due to the extensive use of carbon fibre and has a stiffer suspension in order to increase the cornering ability of the car while maintaining its grand touring characteristicsThe steering of the car has also received modifications and a torque vectoring system to control the power sent to each wheel of the car for improved handling in tight corners has been added",0
"Aerodynamic improvements and light weight have been given special consideration in order to keep the car competitive on the race trackThe Chiron Sport became available in late 2018 for an additional US$400,000 on the standard Chiron     110 Ans Bugatti (2019)     Introduced in February 2019, the 110 Ans Bugatti is a limited edition variant of the Chiron Sport developed to celebrate 110 years of BugattiThe car features carbon fibre bodywork finished in matte Steel Blue exterior colour",0
"The body is also accented with Steel Blue bare carbon fibreThe exhaust system of the car is finished in matte black colourThe colours of the French flag are present on the wing mirrors, fuel filler cap and on the underside of the rear wingThe brake calipers are finished in blue colourThe interior of the car is upholstered in blue Alcantara and also has the colours of the French flag present on the headrests of the seats, on the back of the seats and on top of the steering wheel",0
"Production will be limited to 20 units     Les Légendes du Ciel (2020)     Introduced in November 2020, the ""Les Légendes du Ciel"" Chiron is a limited edition version of the Chiron Sport developed to celebrate Bugatti's racing drivers that flew in the French Air ForceThe car features a new grill, a French flag behind the front wheels, a matte grey (""Gris Serpent"") exterior colour with a gloss white stripe in the centre",0
The interior is upholstered in tan leather and turned aluminium Production will be limited to 20 units at €2.88 million each    Chiron Super Sport 300+ (2019) /  Chiron Super Sport 300 (2021)    On 2 August 2019 Bugatti presented a limited production high performance variant of the Chiron called the Chiron Super Sport to owners taking part in the company's 110th-anniversary tour in EuropeThe variant is limited to 30 examples and closely resembles the prototype performing the top speed record run,0
"Changes from the standard Chiron include a more powerful engine, increased top speed, and a characteristic paint scheme featuring a lacquer-coated carbon fibre body with orange stripes, echoing the aesthetics of the company's previous top speed record-breaking cars, the Veyron Super Sport World Record Edition and the Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse World Record CarThe car is powered by a 1,175 kW (1,580 hp; 1,600 PS) quad-turbocharged W16 engine shared with the Bugatti Centodieci, nicknamed ""Thor""",0
"This car has a grey Bugatti logo made of black enamel and silver, the exhaust system from the Centodieci, a modified gearbox with longer ratios and front and rear bumpers optimised for aerodynamics at high speed, resulting in the overall length increase of the car by 248.9 mm (9.8 in)The Super Sport 300+ will also be equipped with a top speed limiter, akin to the one found in the standard Chiron",0
"Without the limiter, Bugatti claims that the car can attain a maximum speed in excess of 483 km/h (300 mph)Bugatti will also prepare the cars of owners who want to take the car to its full potential at the Ehra-Lessien test track    Chiron Super Sport (2022)    The standard version of the 300+ world record carUnlike the 300+, it does not come with interior stiffening and has more leather in the interior like a typical Bugatti Chiron",0
"More visual differences include special redesigned wheels and a paint finish instead of the bare carbon fibre seen in the 300+The Chiron Super Sport will have the same power output as the 300+ but will be limited to 440 km/h (273 mph)It also has the capability to accelerate from 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 5.8 seconds and from 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 12.1 secondsUnlike the 300+, the limiter cannot be disabled by Bugatti in the Super Sport for prepared runs",0
"Production will start in early 2022This is the next generation supercar of the Bugatti Super Sport series present in Veyron and EB110 series cars     Chiron Pur Sport (2020)    On 3 March 2020, Bugatti introduced the Chiron Pur Sport, a handling-focused model which will be limited to 60 unitsThe tachometer has an additional 200 rpm, increasing the redline to 6,900 rpm80 percent of the transmission has been revised for a 15 percent closer gear-ratio spread benefiting the power band",0
"The Pur Sport is 50 kg (110 lb) lighter than the standard Chiron due to a lightweight 3D printed titanium exhaust, a fixed rear spoiler and extensive use of Alcantara, anodised aluminium and titanium on the interiorThe wheels have special spokes called ""aero blades"" which are designed to channel turbulent air near the wheel down the side of the vehicle to the rear diffuserThe tyres are Michelin Sport Cup 2R increasing lateral grip by 10 percent, and were co-developed with Michelin",0
"To improve handling, the springs were made 65 percent stiffer at the front and 33 percent at the rear, aided by revised damper tuning and wheel camber along with additional front and rear carbon-fibre anti-roll bars and a new Sport+ drive modeProduction of the Pur Sport is expected to start in late 2020    Chiron Noire (2020)   Bugatti announced a special-edition, the Chiron Noire, celebrating the 1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Coupé Aero No",0
"57453 (also known as ""La Voiture Noire"") following the 2019 one-off homage and namesake ""La Voiture Noire""The special edition comes in two versions, the Noire Élégance (black exposed carbon body) and the Noire Sportive (black exposed carbon body covered with a matte black finish)Only 20 will be madeThe Noire starts at around $3.3 million, and deliveries are expected to begin in mid-2020The Chiron Noire package is available for the entry-level Chiron or the Chiron Sport, in this case at an extra charge of €100,000",0
"    Bugatti La Voiture Noire    The La Voiture Noire is a one-off special introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor ShowBased on the Chiron, the design of the car harkens back to the Type 57 SC Atlantic and is a celebration of the company's distinctive design historyThe car has a hand-built body made from carbon fibre designed by Bugatti designer Etienne Salomé which has an elongated nose (similar to that on the Divo) and an elongated rear section",0
"Other notable features include unique wing mirrors, LED taillight strip, and wheelsUnlike the original, the car retains the mid-engine layoutA trim piece running from the front of the car to the rear spoiler recalls the dorsal fin present on the Type 57 SCThe car features a floating windscreen and has masked A-pillarsThe La Voiture Noire's shares large design similarities from the Bugatti Rembrandt, a cancelled front-engine grand tourer powered by the Chiron's W16 engine.The La Voiture Noire will be powered by the same 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged W16 engine from the Chiron having the same power output figures but the 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox and the all-wheel-drive system are heavily revised in order to allow for a more relaxed driving experience",0
"Softer dampers and a revised chassis contribute to the factorThe car features six exhaust pipes recalling the innovative design of the pastPerformance figures remain unknown but the company states that the car is likely to have a lower top speed and acceleration times as compared to the Chiron due to its Grand Touring natureThe car was sold for a price of $18.68 million, making it one of the most expensive cars built to date.A statement made later by the company confirmed that the car on display was a concept car and that the final product would take two and a half years more to complete",0
"The show car had electric motors instead of an engine for easy maneuverability    Records       Acceleration and braking record    At the 2017 IAA show in Frankfurt, Bugatti announced that the Chiron broke the record of fastest 0–400–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) acceleration time, completing it in 41.96 seconds in a span of 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) at the Ehra-Lessien high-speed ovalThe car was driven by Colombian racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya.Bugatti also added an extra livery to the Chiron on display to confirm that it was the same car that broke the 0–400–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) record",0
"During the show, Bugatti also mentioned that during the run, the car accelerated from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.1 seconds, 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.1 seconds, and 0–400 km/h (0–248.5 mph) in 32.6 seconds, which altogether, also makes the Chiron faster than its predecessor, the Veyron    Top speed achievement   On 2 August 2019, Bugatti test driver Andy Wallace achieved a speed of 490.48 km/h (304.77 mph) in a pre-production Chiron Super Sport 300+ prototype at Volkswagen's test facility in Ehra-Lessien",0
"The speed was verified by the TÜV, Germany's Technical Inspection AssociationThis speed was not achieved using a production modelIn its final, road-legal production form, the Chiron SS 300+ has a limited top speed of 436 km/h (271 mph) The car was developed under Bugatti head exterior designer Frank Heyl in collaboration with Italian automobile engineering firm Dallara and tyre manufacturer Michelin over the course of six monthsThe overall length of the car was increased by 248.9 mm (9.8 in) and it is fitted by a laser-controlled ride height system in order to reduce drag",0
"To further reduce drag and aid aerodynamics, the electronically controlled rear wing was removed and was replaced with a long tail incorporating a rear wing with a short cross-sectionA full roll cage was added for safety reasons, and the passenger seat was removed to make way for data recording equipment used to validate the record runThe car incorporates an exhaust system first introduced on the Bugatti Centodieci in order to further reduce aerodynamic drag",0
"Mechanically, the engine was modified to generate 1,177 kW (1,578 hp; 1,600 PS) of power output with no changes to the gearbox and all-wheel-drive system    Cars made on the basis of the Bugatti Chiron by car tuners       Mansory Centuria    The Mansory Centuria is a car made on the basis of the Bugatti Chiron by the German car modification firm, MansoryIt was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show The car features a new rim system, a new air intake on the roof, new lower bodywork made on the basis of the Bugatti Divo's and a new exhaust system",0
" The Interior has been handcrafted, utilizing more leather while new carbon fibre applications have been addedThe Mansory and Centuria badges replace the stock badges inside (on the headrests etc.)The Centuria has a tuned version of an original Chiron engine, increasing its capabilities.The Mansory Centuria was worth 4.7 million U.SDollars in 2019    Production   Production as of March 2021:     Marketing   The Chiron was recreated in Lego as 2018's annual Technic sports car",0

"Rowing, sometimes called crew in the United States, is the sport of racing boats using oarsIt differs from paddling sports in that rowing oars are attached to the boat using oarlocks, while paddles are not connected to the boatRowing is divided into two disciplines: sculling and sweep rowingIn sculling, each rower holds two oars—one in each hand, while in sweep rowing each rower holds one oar with both hands",0
"There are several boat classes in which athletes may compete, ranging from single sculls, occupied by one person, to shells with eight rowers and a coxswain, called eightsThere are a wide variety of course types and formats of racing, but most elite and championship level racing is conducted on calm water courses 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) long with several lanes marked using buoysModern rowing as a competitive sport can be traced to the early 17th century when professional watermen held races (regattas) on the River Thames in London, England",0
"Often prizes were offered by the London Guilds and Livery CompaniesAmateur competition began towards the end of the 18th century with the arrival of ""boat clubs"" at British public schoolsSimilarly, clubs were formed at colleges within Oxford and Cambridge in the early nineteenth centuryPublic rowing clubs were beginning at the same time in England, Germany, the United StatesIn 1843, the first American college rowing club was formed at Yale College",0
"Rowing is one of the oldest Olympic sportsThough it was on the programme for the 1896 games, racing did not take place due to bad weatherMale rowers have competed since the 1900 Summer OlympicsWomen's rowing was added to the Olympic programme in 1976Today, there are fourteen boat classes which race at the Olympics  In addition, the sport's governing body, the World Rowing Federation, holds the annual World Rowing Championships with twenty-two boat classes",0
"Across six continents, 150 countries now have rowing federations that participate in the sport Major domestic competitions take place in dominant rowing nations and include The Boat Race and Henley Royal Regatta in the United Kingdom, the Australian Rowing Championships in Australia, the Harvard–Yale Regatta and Head of the Charles Regatta in the United States, and the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta in CanadaMany other competitions often exist for racing between clubs, schools, and universities in each nation",0
"    History    An Egyptian funerary inscription of 1430 BC records that the warrior Amenhotep (Amenophis) II was also renowned for his feats of oarsmanship, though there is some disagreement among scholars over whether there were rowing contests in ancient EgyptIn the Aeneid, Virgil mentions rowing forming part of the funeral games arranged by Aeneas in honour of his fatherIn the 13th century, Venetian festivals called regata included boat races among others.The first known ""modern"" rowing races began from competition among the professional watermen in the United Kingdom that provided ferry and taxi service on the River Thames in London",0
"Prizes for wager races were often offered by the London Guilds and Livery Companies or wealthy owners of riverside housesThe oldest surviving such race, Doggett's Coat and Badge was first contested in 1715 and is still held annually from London Bridge to ChelseaDuring the 19th century these races were to become numerous and popular, attracting large crowdsPrize matches amongst professionals similarly became popular on other rivers throughout Great Britain in the 19th century, notably on the Tyne",0
"In America, the earliest known race dates back to 1756 in New York, when a pettiauger defeated a Cape Cod whaleboat in a race.Amateur competition in England began towards the end of the 18th centuryDocumentary evidence from this period is sparse, but it is known that the Monarch Boat Club of Eton College and the Isis Club of Westminster School were both in existence in the 1790sThe Star Club and Arrow Club in London for gentlemen amateurs were also in existence before 1800",0
"At the University of Oxford bumping races were first organised in 1815 when Brasenose College and Jesus College boat clubs had the first annual race while at Cambridge the first recorded races were in 1827Brasenose beat Jesus to win Oxford University's first Head of the River; the two clubs claim to be the oldest established boat clubs in the worldThe Boat Race between Oxford University and Cambridge University first took place in 1829, and was the second intercollegiate sporting event (following the first Varsity Cricket Match by 2 years)",0
"The interest in the first Boat Race and subsequent matches led the town of Henley-on-Thames to begin hosting an annual regatta in 1839.Founded in 1818, Leander Club is the world's oldest public rowing clubThe second oldest club which still exists is the Der Hamburger und Germania Ruder Club which was founded 1836 and marked the beginning of rowing as an organized sport in GermanyDuring the 19th century, as in England, wager matches in North America between professionals became very popular attracting vast crowds",0
"Narragansett Boat Club was founded in 1838 exclusively for rowingDuring an 1837 parade in Providence, R.I, a group of boatmen were pulling a longboat on wheels, which carried the oldest living survivor of the 1772 Gaspee RaidThey boasted to the crowd that they were the fastest rowing crew on the BayA group of Providence locals took issue with this and challenged them to race, which the Providence group summarily won",0
"The six-man core of that group went on in 1838 to found NBCDetroit Boat Club was founded in 1839 and is the second oldest continuously-operated rowing club in the U.SIn 1843, the first American college rowing club was formed at Yale UniversityThe Harvard–Yale Regatta is the oldest intercollegiate sporting event in the United States, having been contested every year since 1852 (excepting interruptions for wars and the COVID-19 pandemic)",0
" The Schuylkill Navy is an association of amateur rowing clubs of PhiladelphiaFounded in 1858, it is the oldest amateur athletic governing body in the United StatesThe member clubs are all on the Schuylkill River where it flows through Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, mostly on the historic Boathouse RowThe success of the Schuylkill Navy and similar organizations contributed heavily to the extinction of professional rowing and the sport's current status as an amateur sport",0
"At its founding, it had nine clubs; today, there are 12At least 23 other clubs have belonged to the Navy at various timesMany of the clubs have a rich history, and have produced a large number of Olympians and world-class competitors.The sport's governing body, Fédération Internationale des Sociétés d'Aviron, was founded in 1892, and is the oldest international sports federation in the Olympic movement.FISA first organized a European Rowing Championships in 1893",0
"An annual World Rowing Championships was introduced in 1962Rowing has also been conducted at the Olympic Games since 1900 (cancelled at the first modern Games in 1896 due to bad weather)    History of women's rowing    Women row in all boat classes, from single scull to coxed eights, across the same age ranges and standards as men, from junior amateur through university-level to elite athleteTypically men and women compete in separate crews although mixed crews and mixed team events also take place",0
"Coaching for women is similar to that for menThe world's first women's rowing team was formed in 1896 at the Furnivall Sculling Club in LondonThe club, with signature colors a very distinct myrtle and gold, began as a women's club, but eventually allowed the admittance of men in 1901.The first international women's races were the 1954 European Rowing ChampionshipsThe introduction of women's rowing at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal increased the growth of women's rowing because it created the incentive for national rowing federations to support women's events",0
"Rowing at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London included six events for women compared with eight for menIn the US, rowing is an NCAA sport for women but not for men; though it is one of the country's oldest collegiate sports, the difference is in large part due to the requirements of Title IXAt the international level, women's rowing traditionally has been dominated by Eastern European countries, such as Romania, Russia, and Bulgaria, although other countries such as Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Great Britain and New Zealand often field competitive teams",0
"The United States also has had very competitive crews, and in recent years these crews have become even more competitive given the surge in women's collegiate rowingNow there is usually the same number of girls and boys in a group    Technique    While rowing, the athlete sits in the boat facing toward the stern and uses the oars, which are held in place by oarlocks, to propel the boat forward (towards the bow)",0
"Rowing is distinguished from paddling in that the oar is attached to the boat using an oarlock, where in paddling there is no oarlock or attachment of the paddle to the boat The rowing stroke may be characterized by two fundamental reference points: the catch, which is placement of the oar blade in the water, and the extraction, also known as the finish or release, when the rower removes the oar blade from the water",0
"After the blade is placed in the water at the catch, the rower applies pressure to the oar levering the boat forward which is called the drive phase of the strokeOnce the rower extracts the oar from the water, the recovery phase begins, setting up the rower's body for the next strokeAt the catch, the rower places the blade in the water and applies pressure to the oar by pushing the seat toward the bow of the boat by extending the legs, thus pushing the boat through the water",0
"The point of placement of the blade in the water is a relatively fixed point about which the oar serves as a lever to propel the boatAs the rower's legs approach full extension, the rower pivots the torso toward the bow of the boat and then finally pulls the arms towards his or her chestThe hands meet the chest right above the diaphragmAt the end of the stroke, with the blade still in the water, the hands drop slightly to unload the oar so that spring energy stored in the bend of the oar gets transferred to the boat which eases removing the oar from the water and minimizes energy wasted on lifting water above the surface (splashing)",0
"The recovery phase follows the driveThe recovery starts with the extraction and involves coordinating the body movements with the goal to move the oar back to the catch positionIn extraction, the rower pushes down on the oar handle to quickly lift the blade from the water and rapidly rotates the oar so that the blade is parallel to the waterThis process is sometimes referred to as feathering the blade",0
"Simultaneously, the rower pushes the oar handle away from the chestThe blade emerges from the water square and feathers immediately once clear of the waterAfter feathering and extending the arms, the rower pivots the body forwardOnce the hands are past the knees, the rower compresses the legs which moves the seat towards the stern of the boatThe leg compression occurs relatively slowly compared to the rest of the stroke, which affords the rower a moment to recover, and allows the boat to glide through the water",0
"The gliding of the boat through the water during recovery is often called runA controlled slide is necessary to maintain momentum and achieve optimal boat runHowever, various teaching methods disagree about the optimal relation in timing between drive and recoveryNear the end of the recovery, the rower squares the blade into perpendicular orientation with respect to the water and begins another stroke    Boat classes    Broadly, there are two ways to row, sometimes called disciplines: In sweep rowing, each rower has one oar, held with both hands",0
"There are usually an even number of rowers – two, four or eightEach rower's oar will extend to their port or starboardIn the United Kingdom, the port side is referred to as stroke side and the starboard side as bow side; this applies even if the stroke oarsman is rowing on the bow side and/or the bow oarsman on the stroke sideIn sculling each rower has two oars (or sculls), one in each hand",0
"Sculling is usually done without a coxswain in quads, doubles or singlesThe oar in the sculler's right hand extends to port and the oar in the left hand extends to starboard.Within each discipline, there are several boat classesA single regatta (series of races) will often feature races for many boat classesThey are classified using:  Number of rowers: in all forms of modern competition the number is either 1, 2, 4, or 8",0
"Whether there is a coxswain (also referred to as cox)Coxless sweep boats are sometimes called ""straight"", while sculling boats are assumed to be coxless unless stated otherwise.Although sculling and sweep boats are generally identical to each other (except having different riggers), they are referred to using different names: Sculling boat classes:  Sweep boat classes:     Equipment       Racing shell    Racing boats (often called shells) are long, narrow, and broadly semi-circular in cross-section in order to reduce drag in the water",0
"There is some trade off between boat speed and stability in choice of hull shapeThey usually have a fin towards the rear, to help prevent roll and yaw and to increase the effectiveness of the rudderOriginally made from wood, shells are now almost always made from a composite material (usually a double skin of carbon-fiber reinforced plastic with a sandwich of honeycomb material) for strength and weight advantagesWorld Rowing rules specify minimum weights for each class of boat so that no individual team will gain a great advantage from the use of expensive materials or technology",0
"Smaller sculling boats are usually steered by the scullers pulling harder on one side or the other while larger boats often have a rudder, controlled by the coxswain, if present, or by one of the crew using a cable attached to one of the shoesWith the smaller boats, specialist versions of the shells for sculling can be made lighterThe riggers in sculling apply the forces symmetrically to each side of the boat, whereas in sweep oared racing these forces are staggered alternately along the boat",0
"The sweep oared boat has to be stiffer to handle these unmatched forces, so consequently requires more bracing and is usually heavier – a pair (2-) is usually a more robust boat than a double scull (2x) for example, and being heavier is also slower when used as a double scullIn theory, this could also apply to the 4x and 8x, but most rowing clubs cannot afford to have a dedicated large hull which might be rarely used and instead generally opt for versatility in their fleet by using stronger shells which can be rigged for either sweep rowing or sculling",0
"The symmetrical forces also make sculling more efficient than rowing: the double scull is faster than the coxless pair, and the quadruple scull is faster than the coxless fourMany adjustments can be made to the equipment to accommodate the physiques of the crewCollectively these adjustments are known as the boat's rigging    Oar    Oars, sometimes referred to as blades, are used to propel the boatThey are long (sculling: 250–300 cm; sweep oar: 340–360 cm) poles with one flat end about 50 cm long and 25 cm wide, called the blade",0
"Classic blades were made out of wood, but modern blades are made from more expensive and durable synthetic material, the most common being carbon fiberAn 'oar' is often referred to as a blade in the case of sweep oar rowing and as a scull in the case of scullingA sculling oar is shorter and has a smaller blade area than the equivalent sweep oarThe combined blade area of a pair of sculls is however greater than that of a single sweep oar, so the oarsman when sculling is working against more water than when rowing sweep-oared",0
"He is able to do this because the body action in sculling is more anatomically efficient (due to the symmetry)The spoon of oars is normally painted with the colours of the club to which they belongThis greatly simplifies identification of boats at a distanceAs many sports teams have logos printed on their jerseys, rowing clubs have specifically painted blades that each team is associated with    Training equipment    Indoor rowing (on indoor rower, or rowing tank) is a way to train technique and strength by going through the same motions as rowing, with resistance(usually a large tank of water)",0
"Indoor rowing is helpful when there are no rowable bodies of water near by, or weather conditions don't permit rowingA rowing tank is an indoor facility which attempts to mimic the conditions rowers face on open waterRowing tanks are used primarily for off-season rowing, muscle-specific conditioning and technique training, or simply when bad weather prevents open-water training Ergometer rowing machines (colloquially ergs or ergo) simulate the rowing action and provide a means of training on land when waterborne training is restricted, and of measuring rowing fitness",0
"Ergometers do not simulate the lateral balance challenges, the exact resistance of water, or the exact motions of true rowing including the sweep of the oar handlesFor that reason ergometer scores are generally not used as the sole selection criterion for crews (colloquially ""ergs don't float""), and technique training is limited to the basic body position and movementsHowever, this action can still allow a workout comparable to those experienced on the water",0
"Indoor rowing has become popular as a sport in its own right with numerous indoor competitions (and the annual World Championship CRASH-B Sprints in Boston) during the winter off-season    Race formats    There are several formats for rowing races, often called ""regattas""The two most common are side by side and head races    Side-by-side   Most races that are held in the spring and summer feature side-by-side, or sprint racing; all the boats start at the same time from a stationary position, and the winner is the boat that crosses the finish line first",0
"The number of boats in a race typically varies between two (which is sometimes referred to as a dual race) to eight, but any number of boats can start together if the course is wide enough The standard length races for the Olympics and the World Rowing Championships is 2 kilometres (1.24 mi) longIn the United States, some scholastic (high school) races are 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi), while many youth races are the standard 2 kilometres",0
"Masters rowers (rowers older than 27) often race 1,000 mHowever the race distance can and does vary from dashes or sprints, which may be 500 metres (1,640 ft) long, to longer dual races like the 6.8 kilometres (4.2 mi) Boat RaceTwo traditional non-standard distance shell races are the annual Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge and the Harvard-Yale Boat Race which cover courses of approximately 4 miles (6.44 km)The Henley Royal Regatta is also raced upon a non-standard distance at 2,112 meters (1 mile, 550 yards)",0
"In general, multi-boat competitions are organized in a series of rounds, with the fastest boats in each heat qualifying for the next roundThe losing boats from each heat may be given a second chance to qualify through a repechageThe World Rowing Championships offers multi-lane racing in heats, finals and repechagesAt Henley Royal Regatta two crews compete side by side in each round, in a straightforward knock-out format, with no repechages",0
"    Head races    Head races are time trial / processional races that take place from autumn (fall) to early spring (depending on local conditions)Boats begin with a rolling start at intervals of 10 – 20 seconds, and are timed over a set distanceHead courses usually vary in length from 2,000 metres (1.24 mi) to 12,000 metres (7.46 mi), though there are longer races such as the Boston Rowing Marathon and shorter such as Pairs Head",0
"The oldest, and arguably most famous, head race is the Head of the River Race, founded by Steve Fairbairn in 1926 which takes place each March on the river Thames in London, United KingdomHead racing was exported to the United States in the 1950s, and the Head of the Charles Regatta held each October on the Charles River in Boston, Massachusetts, United States is now the largest rowing event in the world",0
"The Head of the Charles, along with the Head of the Schuylkill in Philadelphia and the Head of the Connecticut, are considered to be the three ""fall classics.""These processional races are known as Head Races, because, as with bumps racing, the fastest crew is awarded the title Head of the River (as in ""head of the class"")It was not deemed feasible to run bumps racing on the Tideway, so a timed format was adopted and soon caught on",0
"Time trials are sometimes used to determine who competes in an event where there is a limited number of entries, for example, the qualifying races for Henley Royal Regatta, and rowing on and getting on for the Oxford and Cambridge Bumps races respectively    Other race  formats    A bumps race is a multi-day race beginning with crews lined up along the river at set intervalsThey start simultaneously and all pursue the boat ahead while avoiding being bumped by a boat from behind",0
"If a crew overtakes or makes physical contact with the crew ahead, a bump is awardedAs a result, damage to boats and equipment is common during bumps racingTo avoid damage the cox of the crew being bumped may concede the bump before contact is actually madeThe next day, the bumping crew will start ahead of any crews that have been bumpedThe positions at the end of the last race are used to set the positions on the first day of the races the next year",0
"Oxford and Cambridge Universities hold bumps races for their respective colleges twice a year, and there are also Town Bumps races in both cities, open to non-university crewsOxford's races are organised by City of Oxford Rowing Club and Cambridge's are organised by the Cambridgeshire Rowing AssociationThe stake format was often used in early American racesCompetitors line up at the start, race to a stake, moored boat, or buoy some distance away, and return",0
"The 180° turn requires mastery of steeringThese races are popular with spectators because one may watch both the start and finishUsually only two boats would race at once to avoid collisionThe Green Mountain Head Regatta continues to use the stake format, but it is run as a head race with an interval startA similar type of racing is found in UK and Irish coastal rowing, where a number of boats race out to a given point from the coast and then return fighting rough water all the way",0
"In Irish coastal rowing the boats are in individual lanes with the races consisting of up to 3 turns to make the race distance 2.3 km    Boat positions    Rowers in multi-rower boats are numbered sequentially from the bow aftThe number-one rower is called the bowman, or just 'bow', whilst the rower closest to the stern is called the 'strokeman' or just 'stroke'There are some exceptions to this – some UK coastal rowers, and in France, Spain, and Italy rowers number from stern to bow",0
"In addition to this, certain crew members have other titles and rolesIn an 8+ the stern pair are responsible for setting the stroke rate and rhythm for the rest of the boat to followThe middle four (sometimes called the ""engine room"" or ""power house"") are usually the less technical, but more powerful rowers in the crew, whilst the bow pair are the more technical and generally regarded as the pair to set up the balance of the boat",0
"They also have most influence on the line the boat steers    Coxswain    The coxswain (or simply the cox) is the member who steers the boat using rudder strings, and coordinates the power and rhythm of the rowers, by communicating to the crew, often through a device called a cox box and speakersThe cox usually sits in the stern of the boat facing the rowers but in bowloaders, usually seen in the coxed four and coxed pair types of boat,the coxswain lies in the bow",0
"It is an advantage for the coxswain to be light as this requires less effort for the crew to propel the boatIn many competitive events there is a minimum weight, 55 kilograms (121 lb) under World Rowing rules, set for the coxswain to prevent unfair advantageIf a coxswain is under the minimum weight allowance (underweight), they may have to carry weights in the boat such as sandbags    Athlete categories       Age   At the elite level, the World Rowing Federation recognizes an under 19 category for athletes who are age 18 or less by the end of the calendar year for a given event",0
"The World Rowing Junior Championships is the world championship event for this categoryAthletes under 23 years of age by the end of the calendar year may compete in the under 23 category, and the World Rowing U23 Championships is held for these athletesWorld Rowing uses the term ""Senior"" for events open to any age.Under World Rowing rules, athletes may compete in ""Masters"" categories when they reach age 27World Rowing holds the World Rowing Masters Regatta for these athletes, at which there are several age subcategories",0
"    Weight   Lightweight boat classes are restricted by the rowers' weightAccording to the World Rowing Federation, this weight category was introduced ""to encourage more universality in the sport especially among nations with less statuesque people""The first lightweight events were held at the World Championships in 1974 for men and 1985 for womenLightweight rowing was added to the Olympics in 1996As of 2021, the only Olympic lightweight boat classes are the men's and women's double sculls",0
"The World Rowing Federation lightweight standards are:  Men: Crew average 70 kilograms (150 lb) – no rower over 72.5 kilograms (160 lb) Women: Crew average 57 kilograms (126 lb) – no rower over 59 kilograms (130 lb)At the collegiate level in the United States, the lightweight weight requirements can be different depending on competitive seasonFor fall regattas (typically head races), the lightweight cutoff for men is 165.0 lband 135.0 lb",0
"for womenIn the spring season (typically sprint races), the lightweight cutoff for men is 160.0 lb., with a boat average of 155.0 lbfor the crew; for women, the lightweight cutoff is 130.0 lb.For juniors in the United States, the lightweight cutoff for men is 150.0 lb.; for women, it is 130.0 lbIn the fall the weight limits are increased for women, with the cutoff being 135 lb    Pararowing    Adaptive rowing is a special category of races for those with physical disabilities",0
"Under World Rowing rules there are 5 boat classes for adaptive rowers; mixed (2 men and 2 women plus cox) LTA (Legs, Trunk, Arms), mixed intellectual disability (2 men and 2 women plus cox) LTA (Legs, Trunk, Arms), mixed (1 man and 1 woman) TA (Trunk and Arms), and men's and women's AS (Arms and Shoulders)Events are held at the World Rowing Championships and were also held at the 2008 Summer Paralympics",0
"    Governing bodies    The World Rowing Federation, known as FISA until recently, is the sport's international governing bodyWorld Rowing runs the World Rowing Championships, as well as several other international elite competitions including the World Rowing Cup and World Rowing Junior ChampionshipsWorld Rowing also sponsors rowing at the OlympicsWorld Rowing has over 155 national member federations who govern the sport in their respective nations    International competitions    The Olympic Games are held every four years, where only select boat classes are raced (14 in total):  Men: quad scull, double scull, single scull, eight, coxless four, and coxless pair Lightweight Men: double scull Women: quad scull, double scull, single scull, eight, coxless four, and coxless pair Lightweight Women: double scullAt the end of each year, the FISA holds the World Rowing Championships with events in 22 different boat classes",0
"Athletes generally consider the Olympic classes to be premier eventsIn 2017 FISA voted to adopt a new Olympic programme for 2020, whereby the lightweight men's coxless four event was replaced by the women's heavyweight coxless fourThis was done to ensure that rowing had a gender equal Olympic programmeDuring Olympic years only non-Olympic boats compete at the World Championships    Fitness and health   Rowing is one of the few bearing sports that exercises all the major muscle groups, including quads, biceps, triceps, lats, glutes and abdominal muscles",0
"The sport also improves cardiovascular endurance and muscular strengthHigh-performance rowers tend to be tall and muscular: although extra weight does increase the drag on the boat, the larger athletes' increased power tends to compensateThe increased power is achieved through the increased leverage on the oar provided by the longer limbs of the athleteIn multi-person boats (2,4, or 8), the lightest person typically rows in the bow seat at the front of the boat",0
"Rowing is a low-impact sport with movement only in defined ranges, so that twist and sprain injuries are rareHowever, the repetitive rowing action can put strain on knee joints, the spine and the tendons of the forearm, and inflammation of these are the most common rowing injuriesIf one rows with poor technique, especially rowing with a curved rather than straight back, other injuries may surface, including back painsBlisters occur for almost all rowers, especially in the beginning of one's rowing career, as every stroke puts pressure on the hands, though rowing frequently tends to harden hands and generate protective calluses",0
"Holding the oars too tightly or making adjustments to technique may cause recurring or new blisters, as it is common to feather the bladeAnother common injury is getting ""track bites"", thin cuts on the back of one's calf or thigh caused by contact with the seat tracks at either end of the stroke    See also       Further reading   Halberstam, David (1985)The Amateurs: The Story of Four Young Men and Their Quest for an Olympic Gold Medal",0

"Sport was an American sports magazineLaunched in September 1946 by New York-based publisher Macfadden Publications, Sport pioneered the generous use of color photography – it carried eight full-color plates in its first editionSport predated the launch of Sports Illustrated by eight years, and is remembered for bringing several editorial innovations to the genre, as well as creating, in 1948, the Sport Magazine Award, given initially to the outstanding player in 11 major sports",0
"In 1955 the magazine instituted an award honoring the outstanding player in baseball's World Series (Johnny Podres of the Brooklyn Dodgers was the inaugural winner); it  was later expanded to include the pre-eminent post-season performers in the other three major North American team sportsWhat made Sport the most distinctive from Sports Illustrated, however, was that it was a monthly magazine as opposed to SI's weekly distributionSport was published continually between its launch and August 2000, when its then-owner, British publisher EMAP PLC, made the decision to close the money-losing title",0
"As of 2016, the photo archive of Sport, which represents one of the most significant collections of 20th-century sports photography in North America, is housed in Canada in Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia at The Sport Gallery    History       1946–1960s   For many of the middle years of the 20th century, the king of sport magazines in North America was not Time Inc.'s Sports Illustrated, but the brainchild of another publishing house, Macfadden Publications, founded by publisher and fitness authority Bernarr Macfadden",0
"Launched in September 1946, Macfadden's Sport magazine broke new ground, as the first mainstream national sports publication, but also in its editorial innovationsIn those years, Sport had the market for magazine-style sports journalism virtually to itself and, under founding editor Ernest Heyn, pioneered a brand of behind-the-scenes glimpses of the heroes of the day not previously attemptedThe emphasis was not on the games or the teams, but on the elements of human drama that lay beneath",0
"Sport was an icon in the league of LIFE, Look and The Saturday Evening PostMany of the magazine's editorial innovations—such as its Sporttalk digest of short items at the front of the magazine, the Sport special long feature at the back and, in particular, the use of full-page colour portraits of the stars of the day—were later borrowed by the new kid on the block, SI, when it made its debut as a weekly in 1954",0
"In fact, Time Inc., tried to purchase the name ""Sport"", but the company's final offer of $200,000 fell on deaf ears at Macfadden, who would have sold for $50,000 more, so Time Incwent instead with Sports Illustrated, trademarking a name used by two previous failed sports journals, and which had lapsed into public domain     Notable writers for Sport    From its launch in September 1946, with Joe DiMaggio gracing the inaugural cover, Sport magazine thrived in a field it had in its early years essentially to itself; rival The Sporting News then being a weekly newspaper printed on newsprint",0
"Each month its pages were filled with evocative writing by the likes of Grantland Rice, John Lardner, Dan Daniel, Roger Kahn and the magazine's editor, Dick Schaap, plus exquisite photographs by such shooting stars as Ozzie Sweet, George Heyer, Marvin Newman, Hy Peskin and Martin BlumenthalIt continued to thrive for a quarter-century or so, as SI struggled to reach profitability, and to find the right blend of spectator and participatory sports",0
"Ogden Nash wrote his baseball poem ""Line-Up for Yesterday"" for the magazine in 1949     The Sport Award    Representative of Sport magazine's stature, in the hearts and minds of the reading public, but also of the men who ran the leagues and teams across North America, was the magazine's success in establishing the Sport Award in 1955 for the most valuable player in the World SeriesThe concept was expanded over the years until a Sport magazine award was presented to the outstanding post-season performer in all four major team sports, as sanctioned by the leagues",0
"    1970s–2000   But by the early 1970s, Macfadden, lacking Time's deep pockets, was fading, and Sport eventually wound up in the hands of Downe CommunicationsIn 1976, Downe and its family of magazines that included Ladies Home Journal and Redbook, was acquired by The Charter CompanyUnder Downe and Charter, there was a zig-zag in editorial direction, and gradually Sport lost its way, its distinctive voice, and circulation declinedIn 1980, Sport was purchased from the Charter Company by its VP of Corporate and Investor Relations, Park Beeler, through an entity known as MVP Sports",0
"Beeler quickly restructured the personnel of Sport and named Don Hanrahan, a former publisher under Downe, to return to that roleBeeler and Hanrahan immediately implemented a strategic plan of editorial and circulation repositioning with a return to a ""sports in depth"" theme as opposed to attempts to cover sports news Beeler and Hanrahan also solidified Sport's historic role of awarding of the MVP Awards for the Super Bowl, World Series, Stanley Cup, and NBA Championship Series",0
"Circulation practices were improved and re-validatedThis quickly revived the magazine and its advertising baseBeeler then sold MVP Sports to Raymond Hunt of Dallas, who integrated it into his existing publishing enterprises, Southwest Media, which included the very successful D magazine, which was headed by Wick AllisonAllison brought in David Bauer (then–deputy managing editor of Sports Illustrated) as editorUnder Hanrahan as publisher and Bauer as editor, Sport sharply improved its design and editorial content under the ""sports in depth"" theme, and the magazine became profitable for the first time in years",0
"Hanrahan, Allison and Bauer all moved on to other projects after a few yearsThe magazine was sold by Ray Hunt to Petersen Publishing Company in 1988Petersen Publishing continued to publish Sport as a monthly magazine out of its Los Angeles offices In 1997, Sport was relaunched by media industry veterans and new Petersen Publishing Company owners/operators Jim Dunning, Neal Vitale and Claeys Bahrenburg (known for his successful tenure at Hearst)",0
"They moved the magazine back to New York City from Los Angeles, and hired Norb Garrett as Editor-in-ChiefGarrett, who formerly had served as Editor-in-Chief at the start-up College Sports magazine, assumed the mantle from LA-based EIC Cam Benty, and hired a new team in New York City and, along with new President Polly Perkins, led an aggressive editorial overhaul of the brandArt director Anthony D’Elia was hired from Hearst, and his team developed a new, modern logo and design aesthetic for the magazine (new logo debuted in October 1997 issue)",0
"Key editorial hires included Managing Editor John Roach, Photo Editor Grace How, Associate Editor Scott Burton (ESPN), Copy Chief Steve Gordon (ESPN) and staff writers Darryl Howerton and Dave Scott (ESPN)From 1997 to 2000, Sport's editorial team launched numerous innovative platforms, including the Heroes of Sport (honoring athletes and their humanitarian efforts), Bargains and Bandits (An annual list of the best and worst contract deals in sports) and Dominators and Abominators of Sport (The best and worst of athletics), which was an annual one-hour TV show on CBS Sports",0
"During that period, Sport editorial also launched the first recurring front-of-book photo gallery (“Impact”) in a consumer sports magazine and introduced “RAWSport”, a monthly look at some of the fledgling extreme sportsThat coverage led Sport and Petersen to launch the extreme sports competition event with NBC Sports, “The Gravity Games,” which debuted in Providence, RI, in 1999In June 1998, Petersen Publishing purchased Inside Sport magazine from Century Publishing and folded Inside Sport into Sport",0
"The combined circulation exceeded 1 million subscribers Sport's editorial team also produced several annual sports magazines, including “Dick Vitale’s College Basketball Yearbook” and “Bob Griese’s College Football Yearbook” as well as launched innovative fantasy baseball and football preview magazines as fantasy sports became more popularFollowing the sale of Petersen Publishing to UK publisher EMAP in 1999, Garrett moved to California to run the company's Action Sports Group consisting of titles such as Surfer, Powder, Skateboarder and Bike, while Roach took over as Editor-in-Chief",0
"     The end of Sport    In August 2000, after appearing every month for 54 years under 10 different owners, Sport magazine ceased publication following EMAP's decision to shutter the titleSport's demise was duly mournedAllen Barra, writing in Salon, put it this way: ""Though it didn't make any headlines, the news of the death of Sport magazine...must have put a lump in the throat of those old enough to remember the greatest of all American sports magazines...Sports Illustrated was great, but SI, in an era when you couldn't see all the highlights every night, was read for news; Sport was for reflection."" And, in a rare departure for the competitive magazine industry, SI itself paid tribute to Sport on its own pages with a poignant piece that began, ""They closed the barbershop last week, the one in town, the first place – not counting school or a friend's house – where your mother would drop you off and leave you..."".In 2015, Sport was reestablished by Tom Ficara and TVS Television Network as an E Magazine with occasional printed special editions",0
Sport diving is an underwater sport that uses recreational open circuit scuba diving equipment and consists of a set of individual and team events conducted in a swimming pool that test the competitors' competency in recreational scuba diving techniquesThe sport was developed in Spain during the late 1990s and is currently played mainly in Europe It is known as Plongée Sportive en Piscine in French and as Buceo De Competición in Spanish,0
"    Objectives   The international rules of competition contain the following four objectives for Sport Diving - firstly, encourage the further development of recreational scuba diving equipment and technique; secondly, promote scuba diving activities in localities that are remote from suitable diving sites or where open water activity may be prohibited by seasonal or adverse weather conditions; thirdly, to provide an opportunity for recreational scuba divers to practice and improve technique; and fourthly, the promotion of scuba diving carried out in swimming pools as a spectator sport for underwater diving enthusiasts",0
"    Equipment   Each competitor is required to have the following recreational diving equipment - a diving mask, fins, a snorkel, a buoyancy compensator, a diving weighting system that is independent of the buoyancy compensator, a diving regulator designed for open circuit scuba and fitted with both an alternative air source for use during the Obstacle Course event (refer below) and a submersible pressure gauge, a diving cylinder with an internal volume between 10 and 18 litres and filled with only breathing air of atmospheric origin, and an exposure suit such as a wetsuit or an isothermal garment such as a dry suit, and footwear such as wetsuit boots",0
" Competitors will also be required to wear a swimming costume of the style used for competitive swimming The use of the snorkel is usually compulsory for the Event M 300 metres (refer below) and optional in all other events.Equipment as a diving watch or a diving computer is optional for a competitor to have as underwater timekeeping is carried out by competition officials The requirements of laws and practices in force at the place of competition may modify or vary the above requirements, i.e",0
"diving cylinder internal volume and pressure rating Some events such as Immersion 6 kg, Night Diving and Briefing do require additional items of personal equipment (refer below)    Competition area   The sport is conducted in a 50m swimming pool with a minimum depth of 2m The International rules do allow the Obstacle Course event to be conducted in natural water bodies that satisfy the definition of ‘sheltered water’ (i.e‘confined water with swimming pool like conditions’)",0
"    Events   As of December 2007, the sport had 5 events codified for competition at international level These consisted of 3 individual events -  Event M 300 metres, Night Diving and Immersion 6 kg; and 2 team events - Obstacle Course and BriefingAdditional events have been developed in Spain by Federación Española de Actividades Subacuáticas (FEDAS) and are included in local, regional and national Sport Diving competitions in that country    Individual events   Event M 300 metres is a time trial event conducted over 300m (i.e",0
"6 laps of a 50m pool) and consisting of the following activities:  1st lap - entry using scuba, removal of scuba set at mid-lap, free swimming ascent to the surface and commencement of surface swim using snorkel2nd lap - surface swim3rd lap - free dive to locate, recover and don scuba set, and commencement of underwater swim on scuba 4th to 6th laps - underwater swim on scuba.Night Diving is an event where a competitor wearing a blacked-out diving mask needs to find 3 items placed on the bottom of the swimming pool within 3 minutes",0
" The competitor is provided with a drag rope of length no longer than 5m, a clip for tying up the rope and a bag to hold collected items The competitor after donning the blacked-out dive mask is escorted on the surface by a judge to a basic shot line moored in the centre of the competition area The competitor then descends to the pool bottom to commence searching The 3 items are placed 4 metres apart and at distances of 2, 3 and 4 metres from the centre of the competition area",0
 Competitors are ranked using a scoring system that gives points for the number of items collected and the collection of items in the quickest time.Immersion 6kg is an event involving the lifting of a 6 kg weight from the bottom of a swimming pool to the surface using a lifting bag The first competitor to successfully compete the task is the winner    Team events   Obstacle Course is a time based event where a buddy pair swims a distance of 100 m in a course occupying 2 full swimming pool lanes whilst carrying out the following sequence of tasks:  Swim through a 2 m long tunnel made of 1 m diameter hoops suspended in mid-water in each lane starting at the 5 m mark,0
The divers then make contact and breathe from one cylinder using an alternative air source from the 12 m mark until they reach the 42 m mark where the recipient diver resumes breathing from their own cylinderEach diver then removes their diving mask and places it in a basket located at the 45 m mark in each lane and then swims to the 50 m mark (i.ethe end of pool) and then returns to the basket to collect and refit their mask,0
"Prior to entering a single 5 m long tunnel located at the 65 m marker, each diver removes their scuba set and swim through the tunnel in single file holding the scuba set in front of them.After exiting the 5 m tunnel, each diver refits their scuba set, collects an object moored on the pool bottom at the 73 m mark and ascends to the surface as a pairOn the surface at the 75 m mark, the buddy pair swims to the 100 m marker (i.e",0
"the end of the course) whilst towing the ‘object’ and breathing from the atmosphere.Competitors are ranked according to the time taken to complete the course plus the addition of time penalties for mistakes made during the course (i.eusing hands during underwater swimming and touching the obstacles).Briefing is a time-based event in which a team of 4 divers carry out a search and information gathering task after receiving instructions whilst underwater The event operates in the following sequence:  Just before entering the pool, a member of the team (identified as the Team Captain in the rules)  is instructed on the order of the search for and what information is to be recorded from 16 ‘signal-pliers’",0
" These are equally spaced across the bottom of the pool with 4 in each quadrant of the poolThe divers enter the pool from its 4 corners and swim underwater to meet in the middle where the Team Captain communicates the taskThe 4 team members each search a quadrant of the pool for the ‘signal-pliers’ in the required order and record the required information in their personal notebooksWhen all of the information is collected, the divers return to the middle of the pool to review the results",0
" The Team Captain checks the collected information for correctness and may amend a particular notebook or send a diver back to a particular ‘signal-plier’ to confirm the required informationWhen the Team Captain is finally satisfied, the team ascend to the surface of the pool as a group.Teams are ranked using a scoring system that gives points for precision and the completion of the task in the quickest time    Governing body   The governing body is the Sport Diving Commission of the CMAS Sport Committee",0
"  As of June 2013, the following countries have affiliated with the Commission - Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belarus, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Poland, Russia, Spain and Ukraine     Origins and history   The creation of the sport is attributed to Marifé Abad, a resident of Zaragoza, Spain who developed it during the years 1998 to 2000 The inspiration for the sport is attributed to Ángel Martínez Lardiés of the Aragonese Federation of Underwater Activities (FARAS) who originally designed the activity now known as the Event M 300 metres",0
" The first competition was held during 2000 in Zaragoza It was introduced to CMAS at its general assembly held in Seville, Spain during 2005 During 2007, draft rules of competition were prepared by the Russian Underwater Federation and it was demonstrated at the First World Underwater Games held in Bari, Italy During 2008, it was made an official CMAS underwater sport at the CMAS General Assembly in Hurghada, Egypt and it was added to the Russian Register of sports",0
" Its peak body, the Sport Diving Commission first officially met at the 2009 CMAS General Assembly in Phuket, Thailand with Marifé Abad as its chair    Competitor admission requirements   Competitors must have a Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) diving certification and must be 16 years of age in order to participate Competitors are classified by gender and by age at the first day of year in which the competition is held - Junior (16–17 years old) and Senior (18 years old)",0

"Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running, jumping, throwing, and walkingThe most common types of athletics competitions are track and field, road running, cross country running, and racewalkingThe results of racing events are decided by finishing position (or time, where measured), while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attemptsThe simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes athletics one of the most common types of sports in the world",0
"Athletics is mostly an individual sport, with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes' performances for a team score, such as cross countryOrganized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BCThe rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century, and were then spread to other parts of the world",0
"Most modern top level meetings are held under the auspices of World Athletics, the global governing body for the sport of athletics, or its member continental and national federationsThe athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer OlympicsThe foremost international athletics meeting is the World Athletics Championships, which incorporates track and field, marathon running and race walkingOther top level competitions in athletics include the World Athletics Cross Country Championships and the World Half Marathon Championships",0
"Athletes with a physical disability compete at the Summer Paralympics and the World Para Athletics ChampionshipsThe word athletics is derived from the Ancient Greek ἀθλητής (athlētēs, ""combatant in public games"") from ἆθλον (athlon, ""prize"") or ἆθλος (athlos, ""competition"")Initially, the term described athletic contests in general – i.esporting competition based primarily on human physical featsIn the 19th century, the term athletics acquired a more narrow definition in Europe and came to describe sports involving competitive running, walking, jumping and throwing",0
"This definition continues to be prominent in the United Kingdom and the former British Empire Related words in Germanic and Romance languages also have a similar meaningIn much of North America, athletics is synonymous with sports in general, maintaining the historical usage of the termThe word ""athletics"" is rarely used to refer to the sport of athletics in this regionTrack and field is preferred, and is used in the United States and Canada to refer to athletics events, including racewalking and marathon running (although cross country running is typically considered a separate sport)",0
"    History       Ancient    Athletic contests in running, walking, jumping and throwing are among the oldest of all sports and their roots are prehistoricAthletics events were depicted in the Ancient Egyptian tombs in Saqqara, with illustrations of running at the Heb Sed festival and high jumping  appearing in tombs from as early as of 2250 BCThe Tailteann Games were an ancient Celtic festival in Ireland, founded circa 1800 BC, and the thirty-day meeting included running and stone-throwing among its sporting events",0
"The original and only event at the first Olympics in 776 BC was a stadium-length running event  known as the stadionThis later expanded to include throwing and jumping events within the ancient pentathlonAthletics competitions also took place at other Panhellenic Games, which were founded later around 500 BC    Modern era   The Cotswold Olympic Games, a sports festival which emerged in 17th century England, featured athletics in the form of sledgehammer throwing contests",0
"Annually, from 1796 to 1798, L'Olympiade de la République was held in revolutionary France, and is an early forerunner to the modern Olympic GamesThe premier event of this competition was a running event, but various ancient Greek disciplines were also on displayThe 1796 Olympiade marked the introduction of the metric system into the sport.Athletics competitions were held about 1812 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and in 1840 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire at the Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt",0
"The Royal Military Academy at Woolwich held an organised competition in 1849, and a regular series of closed meetings open only to undergraduates, was held by Exeter College, Oxford from 1850The annual Wenlock Olympian Games, first held in 1850 in Wenlock, England, incorporated athletics events into its sports programme.The first modern-style indoor athletics meetings were recorded shortly after in the 1860s, including a meet at Ashburnham Hall in London which featured four running events and a triple jump competition.The Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) was established in England in 1880 as the first national body for the sport of athletics and began holding its own annual athletics competition – the AAA Championships",0
"The United States also began holding an annual national competition – the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships – first held in 1876 by the New York Athletic ClubAthletics became codified and standardized via the English AAA and other general sports organisations in the late 19th century, such as the Amateur Athletic Union (founded in the US in 1888) and the Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques (founded in France in 1889)",0
"An athletics competition was included in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and it has been as one of the foremost competitions at the quadrennial multi-sport event ever sinceOriginally for men only, the 1928 Olympics saw the introduction of women's events in the athletics programmeAthletics is part of the Paralympic Games since the inaugural Games in 1960Athletics has a very high-profile during major championships, especially the Olympics, but otherwise is less popular",0
"An international governing body, the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), was founded in 1912It enforced amateur sport status on competitions during much of the 20th centuryProfessional competition continued at a low level, becoming increasingly more common as the century progressedThe International Track Association briefly formed a professional track and field circuit in the United States in the 1970sAthletes used their increasing status to push for remuneration and the IAAF responded with the IAAF Golden Events series and the establishment an outdoor World Championships in 1983, including track and field, racewalking and a marathon event",0
"In modern times, athletes can receive money for racing, putting an end to the so-called ""amateurism"" that existed beforeThe global body updated the name to the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2001, moving away from its amateur origins, before taking on its current name World Athletics in 2019.The Comité International Sports des Sourds had been formed by 1922, to govern international deaf sports, including athletics.The first organized international competitions for athletes with a  physical disability (not deaf) began in 1952, when the first international Stoke Mandeville Games were organized for World War II veterans",0
"This only included athletes in a wheelchairThis inspired the first Paralympic Games, held in 1960Competitions would over time be expanded to include mainly athletes with amputation, cerebral palsy and visual impairment, in addition to wheelchair events    Events    World Athletics, the sport's governing body, defines athletics in six disciplines: track and field, [road running], race walking, cross country running, mountain running, and trail runningMountain running was added in 2003 and trail running was added in 2015.All forms of athletics are individual sports with the exception of relay races",0
"However, athletes' performances are often tallied together by country at international championships, and, in the case of cross country and road races, finishing positions or times of the top athletes from a team may be combined to declare a team victorSeveral further forms of competitive running exist outside of the governance of World AthleticsThe International Skyrunning Federation (ISF) governs high-altitude mountain running, defined as skyrunning, and is affiliated with the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation rather than World Athletics",0
"Competitive stair climbing events, usually hosted in skyscrapers, has two common names: vertical running (as described by the ISF) and tower running (as described by the Towerrunning World Association)Snowshoe running is a winter sport governed by the World Snowshoe Federation, which is similarly to cross country running but has athletes wearing snowshoes to race over deep snow on an obstacle-free courseThe International Association of Ultrarunners organises ultra running as an affiliate of World Athletics, but these long-distance forms of competition fit within World Athletics disciplines, albeit with additional distance",0
"    Track and field    Track and field competitions emerged in the late 19th century and were typically contested between athletes who were representing rival educational institutions, military organisations and sports clubsParticipating athletes may compete in one or more events, according to their specialitiesMen and women compete separatelyTrack and field comes in both indoor and outdoor formats, with most indoor competitions occurring in winter, while outdoor events are mostly held in summer",0
"The sport is defined by the venue in which the competitions are held – the track and field stadiumA variety of running events are held on the track which fall into three broad distance categories: sprints, middle-distance, and long-distance track eventsRelay races feature teams comprising four runners each, who must pass a baton to their teammate after a specified distance with the aim of being the first team to finish",0
"Hurdling events and the steeplechase are a variation upon the flat running theme in that athletes must clear obstacles on the track during the raceThe field events come in two types – jumping and throwing competitionsIn throwing events, athletes are measured by how far they hurl an implement, with the common events being the shot put, discus, javelin, and hammer throwThere are four common jumping events: the long jump and triple jump are contests measuring the horizontal distance an athlete can jump, while the high jump and pole vault are decided on the height achieved",0
"Combined events, which include the decathlon (typically competed by men) and heptathlon (typically competed by women), are competitions where athletes compete in a number of different track and field events, with each performance going toward a final points tallyThe most prestigious track and field contests occur within athletics championships and athletics programmes at multi-sport eventsThe Olympic athletics competition and World Championships in Athletics, and the Paralympic athletics competition and World Para Athletics Championships, are the highest and most prestigious levels of competition in track and field",0
"Track and field events have become the most prominent part of major athletics championships and many famous athletes within the sport of athletics come from this disciplineDiscrete track and field competitions are found at national championships-level and also at annual, invitational track and field meetsMeetings range from elite competitions – such as those in the IAAF Diamond League series – to basic all comers track meets, inter-sports club meetings and schools events, which form the grassroots of track and field",0
" Note: Events in italics are competed at indoor world championships only Note: Heptathlon can refer to two different events, each consisting of different disciplines and both recognised by IAAF: the indoor heptathlon for men, and the outdoor heptathlon for women    Road running    Road running competitions are running events (predominantly long distance) which are mainly conducted on courses of paved or tarmac roads, although major events often finish on the track of a main stadium",0
"In addition to being a common recreational sport, the elite level of the sport – particularly marathon races – are one of the most popular aspects of athleticsRoad racing events can be of virtually any distance, but the most common and well known are the marathon, half marathon, 10 km and 5 kmThe marathon is the only road running event featured at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics and the Summer Olympics, although there is also an annual IAAF World Half Marathon Championships",0
"The marathon is also the only road running event featured at the World Para Athletics Championships and the Summer ParalympicsThe World Marathon Majors series includes the six most prestigious marathon competitions at the elite level – the Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York City and Tokyo Marathons The sport of road running finds its roots in the activities of footmen: male servants who ran alongside the carriages of aristocrats around the 18th century, and who also ran errands over distances for their masters",0
"Foot racing competitions evolved from wagers between aristocrats, who pitted their footman against that of another aristocrat in order to determine a winnerThe sport became professionalised as footmen were hired specifically on their athletic ability and began to devote their lives to training for the gambling eventsThe amateur sports movement in the late 19th century marginalised competitions based on the professional, gambling modelThe 1896 Summer Olympics saw the birth of the modern marathon and the event led to the growth of road running competitions through annual events such as the Boston Marathon (first held in 1897) and the Lake Biwa Marathon and Fukuoka Marathons, which were established in the 1940s",0
"The 1970s running boom in the United States made road running a common pastime and also increased its popularity at the elite level.Ekiden contests – which originated in Japan and remain very popular there – are a relay race variation on the marathon, being in contrast to the typically individual sport of road running    Cross country running    Cross country running is the most naturalistic of the sports in athletics as competitions take place on open-air courses over surfaces such as grass, woodland trails, and earth",0
"It is both an individual and team sport, as runners are judged on an individual basis and a points scoring method is used for teamsCompetitions are typically long distance races of 3 km (1.9 mi) or more which are usually held in autumn and winterCross country's most successful athletes often compete in long-distance track and road events as wellThe Crick Run in England in 1838 was the first recorded instance of an organised cross country competition",0
"The sport gained popularity in British, then American schools in the 19th century and culminated in the creation of the first International Cross Country Championships in 1903The annual IAAF World Cross Country Championships was inaugurated in 1973 and this remains the highest level of competition for the sportA number of continental cross country competitions are held, with championships taking place in Asia, Europe, North America and South AmericaThe sport has retained its status at the scholastic level, particularly in the United Kingdom and United States",0
"At the professional level, the foremost competitions come under the banner of the IAAF Cross Country Permit MeetingsWhile cross country competitions are no longer held at the Olympics, having featured in the athletics programme from 1912 to 1924, it has been present as one of the events within the modern pentathlon competition since the 1912 Summer OlympicsOne variation on traditional cross country is mountain running, which incorporates significant uphill and/or downhill sections as an additional challenge to the course",0
"Fell running and Orienteering are other competitive sports similar to cross country, although they feature an element of navigation which is absent from the set courses of cross country    Racewalking    Racewalking is a form of competitive walking that usually takes place on open-air roads, although running tracks are also occasionally usedRacewalking is the only sport in athletics in which judges monitor athletes on their techniqueRacewalkers must always have a foot in contact with the ground and their advancing leg must be straightened, not bent at the knee – failure to follow these rules results in disqualification from the race.Racewalking finds its roots in the sport of pedestrianism which emerged in the late 18th century in England",0
"Spectators would gamble on the outcome of the walking competitionsThe sport took on an endurance aspect and competitions were held over long distances or walkers would have to achieve a certain distance within a specified time frame, such as Centurion contests of walking 100 miles (160 km) within 24 hoursDuring this period, racewalking was frequently held on athletics tracks for ease of measurement, and the 1908 Summer Olympics in London saw the introduction of the 3500-metre and 10-mile walks",0
"Racewalking was briefly dropped from the Olympic programme in 1928, but the men's 50 kilometres race walk has been held at every Olympic Games but one since 1932The men's 20 kilometres race walk was added to the Olympic athletics schedule in 1956 and the women's event was first held in 1992The most common events in modern competition are over 10 km, 20 km and 50 km on roads, although women's 3 km and men's 5 km are held on indoor tracks",0
"The highest level racewalking competitions occur at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics and at the Summer Olympics, although the sport also has its own separate major competition – the IAAF World Race Walking Cup – which has been held since 1961The IAAF World Race Walking Challenge forms the primary seasonal competition – athletes earn points for their performances at ten selected racewalking competitions and the highest scoring walkers are entered into that year's IAAF Race Walking Challenge Final",0
"    Categories    The significant variation in people's abilities in the sport of athletics has led to the creation of numerous competitive categories, in order that athletes are pitted against rivals of a similar kind or ability, and to include groups of people who would otherwise not be competitive in open-to-all eventsThe eligibility of athletes for a given category is occasionally a source of controversy among the sport's participants, officials and spectators, with disputes typically being rooted in deliberate cheating in order to gain a competitive advantage or differing cultural perspectives over the eligibility of a category",0
"Beyond the primary categories based on physical attributes, some competitions have further eligibility criteria based on nationality, community membership or occupation    Men's and women's divisions   The foremost division of this kind is by sex[ling]: in athletics, men and women almost exclusively compete against people of the same sexIn contrast to the men's division, the development of the women's division has caused regular dispute in terms of eligibilitySeveral intersex athletes had success in the women's division in the early 20th century, such as Stanisława Walasiewicz and Mary Weston (later Mark), and the IAAF responded by introducing sex verification for all athletes in the women's category, beginning with the disqualification of sprinter Foekje Dillema in 1950 after she refused to be tested",0
"Olympic champion Ewa Kłobukowska became the first athlete to publicly fail the test in 1967 and the humiliation she suffered as a result of the announcement led to sex tests becoming a confidential processHurdler Maria José Martínez-Patiño failed a test and was disqualified in 1985, but publicly fought the ban in court and was reinstated in 1988In 1991, the IAAF replaced the sex chromatin test with general medical tests for athletes of all divisions, due to changes in ethical and scientific viewpoints.The question of eligibility for the women's division continued to be a contentious and public issue into the 21st century, with Caster Semenya and Dutee Chand bearing periods of inegibility and taking the IAAF to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over their bans under the hyperandrogenism rules",0
"An increasing number of trans men and trans women began to compete in the women's division in the 2010s, which caused other athletes in the division to raise questions of fairness in competition.The dispute reached new heights in 2019 with the United Nations Human Rights Council issuing a statement that the IAAF was breaching ""international human rights norms and standards"" through its practice of allowing some athletes to compete in the women's division only once they had lowered their testosterone levels through medical intervention",0
"The IAAF and several prominent women athletes, such as Paula Radcliffe, said this was required in order to prevent a situation where countries deliberately sought out athletes who were intersex, transgender or had a difference in sex development (DSD) in order to succeed in women's sportOthers have argued for the abolition of gender verification testing, with academic Maren Behrensen citing the harm to tested athletes' social and emotional well-being, the inaccuracy of the medical tests, the difficulty of determining the exact performance advantage provided by a given condition, and the moral risk of ""gender-engineering"" by setting a biological definition for a female athlete",0
"    Age    Age is a significant determiner of ability to compete in athletics, with athletic ability generally increasing through childhood and adolescence, peaking in early adulthood, then gradually declining from around the age of 30 onwardsAs a result, numerous age categories have been created to encourage younger and older athletes to engage in competitionAt international level, there are three major categories for young athletes: under-23, under-20 (formerly junior), and under-18 (formerly youth)",0
"Beyond international rules, different youth categories are in use in the sport, often in the form of two-year or single age groupingsAge categories are more extensive for older athletes and these are commonly organised under the umbrella of masters athletics, which has age groups spanning five years for all athletes aged 35 and aboveThere is no limit to the number of age groupings, hence Stanisław Kowalski holds a world record for men aged 105 years and over",0
"For competitions where age is not taken into account, this is known as senior or open class athletics; in international rules there remain some restrictions on younger people competing in endurance events for health reasons.Athletes' eligibility for a competitive age grouping is typically assessed through official documentation, such as birth records or passportsInstances of age cheating have occurred at all of the IAAF's global age category championshipsOne prominent incident was Olympic medalist Thomas Longosiwa, who provided a falsified passport to compete at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics at age 24",0
"Age falsification for youth categories is mostly limited to less developed parts of the world, such as Africa and South Asia, which have less stringent controls on official documentation and many mature athletes engaging in high school competition due to disruptions to educationThe same regions of the world also present issues with age verification in masters age categories, with examples such as Indian distance runners Dharampal Singh Gudha and Fauja Singh (both claiming to be over 100 years old) reaching mainstream attention",0
"    Athletes with disabilities    Athletes with physical disabilities have competed at separate international events since 1952The International Paralympic Committee governs the competitions in athletics, and hosts the Paralympic Games, which have continued since 1960.Competitors at elite level competitions, are classified by disability, to arrange athletes with a similar disability in the same eventA classified T12 athlete for example, is a track athlete with a visual impairmentF   Field athletes T   Track athletes 11–13 – visual impairment",0
"Compete with a sighted guide20 – Intellectual disability 31–38 – cerebral palsy 40–46 – amputation, and others (including athletes with dwarfism) 51–58 – WheelchairOperating independently of the Paralympic movement, deaf athletes have a long-established tradition of organised athletics, with the first major world competition being included at the 1924 DeaflympicsThe primary impediments to the inclusion of deaf athletes in mainstream athletics are sound based elements of the sport, such as the starter's pistol",0
"This can be a disadvantage even in Paralympic sport, as shown in by the example of Olivia Breen who failed to hear a false start in a cerebral palsy class race at the 2012 Paralympics.In wheelchair racing athletes compete in lightweight racing chairs Most major marathons have wheelchair divisions and the elite racers consistently beat the runners on footThe speed of wheel chair racers has caused difficulties for race organisers in properly staggering their start times compared to runners",0
"A collision between Josh Cassidy (a wheelchair racer) and Tiki Gelana (a leading female marathoner) at the 2013 London Marathon brought the issue into the spotlight again.Occasionally, athletes with a disability reach a level at which they can compete against able-bodied athletes Legally blind Marla Runyan ran in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics and won a gold medal in the 1500 metres at the 1999 Pan American Games Oscar Pistorius, a double amputee, was a semi-finalist at the 2011 World Championships and won a silver medal as part of South Africa's 4 × 400 metres relay team",0
"In masters athletics it is far more common to make an accommodation for athletes with a disability Blind Ivy Granstrom set numerous Masters world records while being guided around the track.The disability categories have caused dispute among athletes, with some athletes being accused of exaggerating their level of disability in order to compete in less challenging categoriesAthletes with intellectual disabilities were banned from competition in all Paralymic sports in response to verification issues and cheating at the 2000 Summer Paralympics and the intellectual disability athletics programme was only restored twelve years later at the 2012 Summer Paralympics",0
"    Venues   Professional athletics almost exclusively takes place in one of three types of venue: stadiums, set courses on grass or woodland, and road-based coursesSuch venues ensure that events take place in a relatively standardised manner, as well as improving the safety of athletes and enjoyment for spectatorsAt a more basic level, many forms of athletics demand very little in terms of venue requirements; almost any open space or area of field can provide a suitable venue for basic running, jumping and throwing competitions",0
"    Track and field stadium    A standard outdoor track is in the shape of a stadium, 400 metres in length, and has at least eight lanes 1.22 m in width (small arenas might have six lanes)Older track facilities may have nonstandard track lengths, such as 440 yards (402.3 m; 1/4 mile) (common in the United States)Historically, tracks were covered by a dirt running surfaceModern All-weather running tracks are covered by a synthetic weather-resistant running surface, which typically consists of rubber (either black SBR or colored EPDM granules), bound by polyurethane or latex resins",0
"Older tracks may be cinder-coveredA standard indoor track is designed similarly to an outdoor track, but is only 200 metres in length and has between four and eight lanes, each with width between 0.90 m and 1.10 mOften, the bends of an indoor track will be banked to compensate for the small turning radiusHowever, because of space limitations, indoor tracks may have other nonstandard lengths, such as 160-yard (146.3 m) indoor track at Madison Square Garden used for the Millrose Games",0
"Because of space limitations, meetings held at indoor facilities do not hold many of athletics events typically contested outdoors    Cross country courses    There is no standardised form of cross country course and each venue is significantly defined by the environment it contains – some may be relatively flat and featureless, while others may be more challenging with natural obstacles, tight turns, and undulating groundWhile a small number of purpose-built courses exist, the vast majority of cross country running courses are created by cordoning a specific area within any open natural land, typically a park, woodland or greenspace near a settlement.At the elite and professional level, courses must be looped and each lap must be between 1750 m and 2000 m in length",0
"Severe obstacles such as deep ditches, high barriers and thick undergrowth not normally present; the course should be able to be completed whilst remaining on foot throughoutIn order to maintain the sport's distinction from road running, the usage of unnatural or macadamised surfaces is generally kept to a minimum or avoided entirely.Because the majority of races take place on areas of grass, soil, mud or earth, weather conditions can significantly affect the difficulty of cross country courses, as snow and rain reduces traction and can create areas of standing water",0
"    Road courses    The surface of road races is highly important and the IAAF dictate that the courses must be along man-made roads, bicycle paths or footpathsCourses set along major roads of cities are typical of road running events, and traffic is usually cordoned off from the area during the competitionWhile soft ground, such as grass, is generally avoided, races may start and finish on soft ground or within a track and field stadium",0
"Road racing courses come in two primary types: looped and point-to-pointCourses may be measured and designed to cover a standardised distance, such as 10 km (6.2 mi), or they may simply follow a set route between two landmarks.Road running courses over 5 km usually offer drinks or refreshment stations for runners at designated points alongside the course and medical professionals are present at the courses of major races due to the health risks involved with long-distance running.Elite road walks are conducted on closed loop courses (usually loops of 2,000 or 2,500 meters)",0
"Refreshment stations are also present over long distance walking competitions, with drinks being available on every lap for races longer than 10 km    Organizations   In 1912, the formation of the international governing body for athletics, the International Amateur Athletics Federation, beganIn recognition of the movement of the sport from amateurism towards professionalism that began in the late 1970s, the word amateur was dropped from the name, and the organization was rebranded as the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2001",0
"In late 2019, another rebranding began, with World Athletics as the new title of the governing bodyWorld Athletics has 215 member nations and territories, which are divided into six continental areas (or area associations)The six association areas are for Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, North America and South AmericaThe sports within athletics do not have their own independent governing bodies at either international or continental level; instead, all fall under the athletics authorities",0

"Athletics at international championships, or Games, represent the pinnacle of competition within the sport, and they are contested between athletes representing their country or regionThe organisation of these competitions is usually overseen by either a world, continental, or regional athletics governing bodyAthletes gain entry into these competitions by earning selection from their national athletics governing body, which is generally done by assessing athletes via their past achievements or performances at a national selection event",0
"National championships are annual competitions endorsed by a national governing body which serve the purpose of deciding the country's best athlete in each eventAnnual one-day meetings and races form the most basic level of competition and are the most common format of athletics contestsThese events are often invitational and are organised by sports organisations, sports promoters, or other institutionsCompetitions typically feature only one of the sports within athleticsHowever, major outdoor international athletics championships and athletics competitions held as part of multi-sport events usually feature a combination of track and field, road running and racewalking events     International competitions        Multi-sport events     The modern Summer Olympics was the first event at which a global athletics competition took place",0

"These included the Commonwealth Games, the Central American and Caribbean Games, Universiade, and many othersThe Summer Paralympics include athletes with a physical disabilityTrack and field, and road events have featured in the Paralympic athletics programme since its inception in 1960The Paralympic competition is the most prestigious athletics contest where athletes with a physical disability competeAthletics at the Paralympic Games also include wheelchair racing where athletes compete in lightweight racing chairs",0

"Athletics was much respected in Ancient Greece and the events within the ancient pentathlon provided inspiration for large statues such as the Discobolus and Discophoros, and for motifs on countless vase and pottery worksAristotle discussed the significance of the pentathlon in his treatise Rhetoric and reflected on the athlete aesthetic of the period: ""a body capable of enduring all efforts, either of the racecourse or of bodily strength...This is why the athletes in the pentathlon are most beautiful"".Films about athletics are overwhelmingly focused on running events: the 1962 film The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (based on the book of the same name) explores cross country running as a means of escape",0

"Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sportsHowever, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sportsThe International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner",0
"Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line firstIt can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impressionRecords of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport newsSport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting",0

"Roget's defines the noun sport as an ""activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement"" with synonyms including diversion and recreation    Nomenclature   The singular term ""sport"" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g""children taking part in sport""), with ""sports"" used to describe multiple activities (e.g""football and rugby are the most popular sports in England"")American English uses ""sports"" for both terms    Definition    The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources",0
"The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by SportAccord, which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including association football, athletics, cycling, tennis, equestrian sports, and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of international sportSportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should: have an element of competition be in no way harmful to any living creature not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as arena football) not rely on any ""luck"" element specifically designed into the sport.They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby or athletics), primarily mind (such as chess or Go), predominantly motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating), primarily co-ordination (such as billiard sports), or primarily animal-supported (such as equestrian sport).The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports",0
"Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sportsThere has been an increase in the application of the term ""sport"" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as video games, also called esports (from ""electronic sports""), especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisationsAccording to Council of Europe, European Sports Charter, article 2.i, ""'Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.""     Competition    There are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport, with almost all professional sports involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or SportAccord.Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity",0
"For instance, the Council of Europe include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for funIn order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school sports days, although moves like this are often controversial.In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their ""result"" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g",0
"gender, weight and age)The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with ""handicaps"" or penaltiesIn a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurementIn gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjectiveThere are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time",0

"Industrialisation has brought increased leisure time, letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activitiesThese trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communicationProfessionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes – all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sportsSince the turn of the 21st century, there has been increasing debate about whether transgender sports persons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition gender identity",0

"By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as naïvely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books    Religious views    Sport was an important form of worship in Ancient Greek religionThe ancient Olympic Games, called the Olympiad, were held in honour of the head deity, Zeus, and featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other gods",0
"As many Greeks travelled to see the games, this combination of religion and sport also served as a way of uniting themThe practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which ""human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves."" Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of ""collective pride"" and ""national self-deification"" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship.Tertullian condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting ""the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry."" The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:  God has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness",0
"..Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to thatThen, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them – the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ",0
" Christian clerics in the Wesleyan-Holiness movement oppose the viewing of or participation in professional sports, believing that professional sports leagues profane the Sabbath as in the modern era, certain associations hold games on the Lord's DayThey also criticize professional sports for its fostering of a commitment that competes with a Christian's primary commitment to God in opposition to 1 Corinthians 7:35, what they perceive to be a lack of modesty in the players' and cheerleaders' uniforms (which are not in conformity with the Methodistic doctrine of outward holiness), its association with violence in opposition to Hebrews 7:26, what they perceive to be the extensive use of profanity among many players that contravenes Colossians 3:8–10, and the frequent presence of gambling, as well as alcohol and other drugs at sporting events, which go against a commitment to teetotalism",0

"An island (or isle) is an isolated piece of habitat that is surrounded by a dramatically different habitat, such as waterVery small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keysAn island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holmSedimentary islands in the Ganges delta are called chars",1
"A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands, such as the Philippines, is referred to as an archipelagoAn island may be described as such, despite the presence of an artificial land bridge; examples are Singapore and its causeway, and the various Dutch delta islands, such as IJsselmondeSome places may even retain ""island"" in their names for historical reasons after being connected to a larger landmass by a land bridge or landfill, such as Coney Island and Coronado Island, though these are, strictly speaking, tied islands",1
"Conversely, when a piece of land is separated from the mainland by a man-made canal, for example the Peloponnese by the Corinth Canal, more or less the entirety of Fennoscandia by the White Sea Canal, or Marble Hill in northern Manhattan during the time between the building of the United States Ship Canal and the filling-in of the Harlem River which surrounded the area, it is generally not considered an islandThere are two main types of islands in the sea: continental and oceanic",1
"There are also artificial islands, which are man-made    Etymology   The word island derives from Middle English iland, from Old English igland (from ig or ieg, similarly meaning 'island' when used independently, and -land carrying its contemporary meaning; cfDutch eiland (""island""), German Eiland (""small island""))However, the spelling of the word was modified in the 15th century because of a false etymology caused by an incorrect association with the etymologically unrelated Old French loanword isle, which itself comes from the Latin word insula",1
"Old English ieg is actually a cognate of Swedish ö and German Aue, and related to Latin aqua (water).Islets are very small islands    Relationships with Continents       Differentiation from continents    There is no standard of size that distinguishes islands from continents, or from islets.There is a difference between islands and continents in terms of geologyContinents are the largest landmass of a particular continental plate; this holds true for Australia, which sits on its own continental lithosphere and tectonic plate (the Australian Plate).By contrast, islands are either extensions of the oceanic crust (e.g",1
"volcanic islands), or belong to a continental plate containing a larger landmass (continental islands); the latter is the case of Greenland, which sits on the North American Plate    Continental islands    Continental islands are bodies of land that lie on the continental shelf of a continentExamples are Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Sakhalin, Taiwan and Hainan off Asia; New Guinea, Tasmania, and Kangaroo Island off Australia; Great Britain, Ireland, and Sicily off Europe; Greenland, Newfoundland, Long Island, and Sable Island off North America; and Barbados, the Falkland Islands, and Trinidad off South America",1
"     Microcontinental islands    A special type of continental island is the microcontinental island, which is created when a continent is riftedExamples are Madagascar and Socotra off Africa, New Caledonia, New Zealand, and some of the Seychelles     Bars    Another subtype is an island or bar formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacityThis includes:  barrier islands, which are accumulations of sand deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves fluvial or alluvial islands formed in river deltas or midstream within large rivers",1
"While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived    Oceanic islands        Tectonic versus volcanic    Oceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelvesThe vast majority are volcanic in origin, such as Saint Helena in the South Atlantic OceanThe few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are tectonic in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface",1
"Examples are the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean and Macquarie Island in the South Pacific Ocean     Volcanic islands         Arcs    One type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arcThese islands arise from volcanoes where the subduction of one plate under another is occurringExamples are the Aleutian Islands, the Mariana Islands, and most of Tonga in the Pacific OceanThe only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the Lesser Antilles and the South Sandwich Islands",1
"     Oceanic Rifts    Another type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an oceanic rift reaches the surfaceThere are two examples: Iceland, which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and Jan MayenBoth are in the Atlantic     Hotspots    A third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic hotspotsA hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving tectonic plate above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts",1
"Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually ""drowned"" by isostatic adjustment and eroded, becoming a seamountPlate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movementAn example is the Hawaiian Islands, from Hawaii to Kure, which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the Emperor SeamountsAnother chain with similar orientation is the Tuamotu Archipelago; its older, northerly trend is the Line Islands",1
"The southernmost chain is the Austral Islands, with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of TuvaluTristan da Cunha is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic OceanAnother hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of Surtsey, which was formed in 1963     Atolls    An atoll is an island formed from a coral reef that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic islandThe reef rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island",1
"Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central lagoonExamples are the Line Islands in the Pacific and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean    Tropical islands    Approximately 45,000 tropical islands with an area of at least 5 hectares (12 acres) existExamples formed from coral reefs include Maldives, Tonga, Samoa, Nauru, and PolynesiaGranite islands include Seychelles and TiomanThe socio-economic diversity of tropical islands ranges from the Stone Age societies in the interior of North Sentinel, Madagascar, Borneo, and Papua New Guinea to the high-tech lifestyles of the city-islands of Singapore and Hong Kong.International tourism is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Mauritius,  Réunion, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Maldives",1
"    De-islanding   The process of de-islandisation is often concerning bridging, but there are other forms of linkages such as causeways: fixed transport links across narrow necks of water, some of which are only operative at low tides (e.gthat connecting Cornwall’s St Michael’s Mount to the peninsular mainland) while others (such as the Canso Causeway connecting Cape Breton to the Nova Scotia mainland), are usable all-year-round (aside from interruptions during storm surge periods)",1
"Another type of connection is fostered by harbour walls/breakwaters that incorporate offshore islets into their structures, such as those in Sai harbour in northern Honshu, Japan, and the connection to the mainland which transformed Ilhéu do Diego from an isletDe-islanded through its fixed link to the mainland, the former islet’s name, Ilhéu do Diego, became functionally redundant (and thereby archaic) and the location took the fort as its nomenclative reference point",1
Some former island sites have retained designations as islands after the draining/subsidence of surrounding waters and their fixed linkage to land (England’s Isle of Ely and Vancouver’s Granville Island being respective cases in point)Their names are thereby archaic in that they reflect the islands’ pasts rather than their present structures and/or transport logistics    Artificial islands    Almost all of Earth's islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions,1
"However, artificial (man-made) islands also exist, such as the island in Osaka Bay off the Japanese island of Honshu, on which Kansai International Airport is locatedArtificial islands can be built using natural materials (e.g., earth, rock, or sand) or artificial ones (e.g., concrete slabs or recycled waste)Sometimes natural islands are artificially enlarged, such as Vasilyevsky Island in the Russian city of StPetersburg, which had its western shore extended westward by some 0.5 km in the construction of the Passenger Port of St",1

"Moderate is an ideological category which designates a rejection of radical or extreme views, especially in regard to politics and religionA moderate is considered someone occupying any mainstream position avoiding extreme views and major social changeIn United States politics, a moderate is considered someone occupying a centre position on the left–right political spectrum    Political position    In recent years, the term political moderates has gained traction as a buzzwordThe existence of the ideal moderate is disputed because of a lack of a moderate political ideology",1
"Voters who describe themselves as centrist often mean that they are moderate in their political views, advocating neither extreme left-wing politics nor extreme right-wing politicsGallup polling indicated that American voters identified as moderate between 35–38% of the time during the 1990s and 2000sVoters may identify with moderation for a number of reasons: pragmatic, ideological or otherwiseIt has also been suggested that individuals vote for centrist parties for purely statistical reasons",1

"A political party is an organization that coordinates candidates to compete in a particular country's electionsIt is common for the members of a party to hold similar ideas about politics, and parties may promote specific ideological or policy goalsPolitical parties have become a major part of the politics of almost every country, as modern party organizations developed and spread around the world over the last few centuriesIt is extremely rare for a country to have no political parties",1
"Some countries have only one political party while others have severalParties are important in the politics of autocracies as well as democracies, though usually democracies have more political parties than autocraciesAutocracies often have a single party that governs the country, and some political scientists consider competition between two or more parties to be an essential part of democracyParties can develop from existing divisions in society, like the divisions between lower and upper classes, and they streamline the process of making political decisions by encouraging their members to cooperate",1
"Political parties usually include a party leader, who has primary responsibility for the activities of the party; party executives, who may select the leader and who perform administrative and organizational tasks; and party members, who may volunteer to help the party, donate money to it, and vote for its candidatesThere are many different ways in which political parties can be structured and interact with the electorateThe contributions that citizens give to political parties are often regulated by law, and parties will sometimes govern in a way that favours the people who donate time and money to them",1
"Many political parties are motivated by ideological goalsIt is common for democratic elections to feature competitions between liberal, conservative, and socialist parties; other common ideologies of very large political parties include communism, populism, nationalism, and IslamismPolitical parties in different countries will often adopt similar colours and symbols to identify themselves with a particular ideologyHowever, many political parties have no ideological affiliation, and may instead be primarily engaged in patronage, clientelism, or the advancement of a specific political entrepreneur",1
"    Definition   Political parties are collective entities that organize competitions for political offices.: 3  The members of a political party contest elections under a shared labelIn a narrow definition, a political party can be thought of as just the group of candidates who run for office under a party label.: 3  In a broader definition, political parties are the entire apparatus that supports the election of a group of candidates, including voters and volunteers who identify with a particular political party, the official party organizations that support the election of that party's candidates, and legislators in the government who are affiliated with the party",1
"In many countries, the notion of a political party is defined in law, and governments may specify requirements for an organization to legally qualify as a political party.According to Anson DMorse, a political party is a durable organization united by common principles which ""has for its immediate end the advancement of the interests and the realization of the ideals..of the particular group or groups which it represents.""Political parties are distinguished from other political groups and clubs, such as political factions or interest groups, mostly by the fact that parties are focused on electing candidates, whereas interest groups are focused on advancing a policy agenda",1
"This is related to other features that sometimes distinguish parties from other political organizations, including a larger membership, greater stability over time, and a deeper connection to the electorate    History   The idea of people forming large groups or factions to advocate for their shared interests is ancientPlato mentions the political factions of Classical Athens in the Republic, and Aristotle discusses the tendency of different types of government to produce factions in the Politics",1
"Certain ancient disputes were also factional, like the Nika riots between two chariot racing factions at the Hippodrome of ConstantinopleA few instances of recorded political groups or factions in history included the late Roman Republic's Populares and Optimates factions as well as the Dutch Republic's Orangists and the StaatsgezindeHowever, modern political parties are considered to have emerged around the end of the 18th century; they are usually considered to have first appeared in Europe and the United States of America, with the United Kingdom's Conservative Party and the Democratic Party of the United States both frequently called the world's ""oldest continuous political party"".Before the development of mass political parties, elections typically featured a much lower level of competition, had small enough polities that direct decision-making was feasible, and held elections that were dominated by individual networks or cliques that could independently propel a candidate to victory in an election.: 510      18th century    Some scholars argue that the first modern political parties developed in early modern Britain in the 18th century, after the Exclusion Crisis and the Glorious Revolution.: 4  The Whig faction originally organized itself around support for Protestant constitutional monarchy as opposed to absolute rule, whereas the conservative Tory faction (originally the Royalist or Cavalier faction of the English Civil War) supported a strong monarchy, and these two groups structured disputes in the politics of the United Kingdom throughout the 18th century: 4  The Rockingham Whigs have been identified as the first modern political party, because they retained a coherent party label and motivating principles even while out of power.At the end of the century, the United States also developed a party system, called the First Party System",1
"Although the framers of the 1787 United States Constitution did not all anticipate that American political disputes would be primarily organized around political parties, political controversies in the early 1790s over the extent of federal government powers saw the emergence of two proto-political parties: the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party    19th century   By the early 19th century, a number of countries had developed stable modern party systemsThe party system that developed in Sweden has been called the world's first party system, on the basis that previous party systems were not fully stable or institutionalized",1
"In many European countries, including Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and France, political parties organized around a liberal-conservative divide, or around religious disputes.: 510  The spread of the party model of politics was accelerated by the 1848 Revolutions around Europe.The strength of political parties in the United States waned during the Era of Good Feelings, but shifted and strengthened again by the second half of the 19th centuryThis was not the only country in which the strength of political parties had substantially increased by the end of the century; for example, around this time the Irish political leader Charles Stewart Parnell implemented several methods and structures like party discipline that would come to be associated with strong grassroots political parties",1
"    20th century   At the beginning of the 20th century in Europe, the liberal—conservative divide that characterized most party systems was disrupted by the emergence of socialist parties, which attracted the support of organized trade unions.: 511 During the wave of decolonization in the mid-20th century, many newly sovereign countries outside of Europe and North America developed party systems that often emerged from their movements for independenceFor example, a system of political parties arose out of factions in the Indian independence movement, and was strengthened and stabilized by the policies of Indira Gandhi in the 1970s.: 165  The formation of the Indian National Congress, which developed in the early 20th century as a pro-independence faction in British India and immediately became a major political party after Indian independence, foreshadowed the dynamic in many newly independent countries; for example, the Uganda National Congress was a pro-independence party and the first political party in Uganda, and its name was chosen as an homage to the Indian National Congress.As broader suffrage rights and eventually universal suffrage slowly spread throughout democracies, political parties expanded dramatically, and only then did a vision develop of political parties as intermediaries between the full public and the government",1
"    Causes of political parties   Political parties are a nearly ubiquitous feature of modern countriesNearly all democratic countries have strong political parties, and many political scientists consider countries with fewer than two parties to necessarily be autocraticHowever, these sources allow that a country with multiple competitive parties is not necessarily democratic, and the politics of many autocratic countries are organized around one dominant political partyThe ubiquity and strength of political parties in nearly every modern country has led researchers to remark that the existence of political parties is almost a law of politics, and to ask why parties appear to be such an essential part of modern states.: 510  Political scientists have therefore come up with several explanations for why political parties are a nearly universal political phenomenon.: 11      Social cleavages    One of the core explanations for the existence of political parties is that they arise from pre-existing divisions among people: society is divided in a certain way, and a party is formed to organize that division into the electoral competition",1
"By the 1950s, economists and political scientists had shown that party organizations could take advantage of the distribution of voters' preferences over political issues, adjusting themselves in response to what voters believe in order to become more competitiveBeginning in the 1960s, academics began identifying the social cleavages in different countries that might have given rise to specific parties, such as religious cleavages in specific countries that may have produced religious parties there.The theory that parties are produced by social cleavages has drawn several criticisms",1
"Some authors have challenged it on empirical grounds, either finding no evidence for the claim that parties emerge from existing cleavages, or arguing that the claim is not empirically testableOthers note that while social cleavages might cause political parties to exist, this obscures the opposite effect: that political parties also cause changes in the underlying social cleavages.: 13  A further objection is that, if the explanation for where parties come from is that they emerge from existing social cleavages, then the theory is an incomplete story of where political parties come from unless it also explains the origins of these social cleavages",1
"    Individual and group incentives    An alternative explanation for why parties are ubiquitous across the world is that the formation of parties provides compatible incentives for candidates and legislatorsFor example, the existence of political parties might coordinate candidates across geographic districts, so that a candidate in one electoral district has an incentive to assist a similar candidate in a different districtThus, political parties can be mechanisms for preventing candidates with similar goals from acting to each other's detriment when campaigning or governing",1
"This might help explain the ubiquity of parties: if a group of candidates form a party and are harming each other less, they may perform better over the long run than unaffiliated politicians, so politicians with party affiliations will out-compete politicians without parties.Parties can also align their member's incentives when those members are in a legislatureThe existence of a party apparatus can help coalitions of electors to agree on ideal policy choices, whereas a legislature of unaffiliated members might never be able to agree on a single best policy choice without some institution constraining their options",1
"    Parties as heuristics    Another prominent explanation for why political parties exist is psychological: parties may be necessary for many individuals to participate in politics because they provide a massively simplifying heuristic, which allows people to make informed choices with much less mental effort than if voters had to consciously evaluate the merits of every candidate individuallyWithout political parties, electors would have to individually evaluate every candidate in every electionBut political parties enable electors to make judgments about just a few groups, and then apply their judgment of the party to all the candidates affiliated with that group",1
"Because it is much easier to become informed about a few parties' platforms than about many candidates' personal positions, parties reduce the cognitive burden for people to cast informed votesHowever, evidence suggests that over the last several decades, the strength of party identification has been weakening, so this may be a less important function for parties to provide than it was in the past    Structure of political parties   Political parties are often structured in similar ways across countries",1
"They typically feature a single party leader, a group of party executives, and a community of party membersParties in democracies usually select their party leadership in ways that are more open and competitive than parties in autocracies, where the selection of a new party leader is likely to be tightly controlledIn countries with large sub-national regions, particularly federalist countries, there may be regional party leaders and regional party members in addition to the national membership and leadership.: 75      Party leaders    Parties are typically led by a party leader, who serves as the main representative of the party and often has primary responsibility for overseeing the party's policies and strategies",1
"The leader of the party that controls the government usually becomes the head of government, such as the president or prime minister, and the leaders of other parties explicitly compete to become the head of governmentIn both presidential democracies and parliamentary democracies, the members of a party frequently have substantial input into the selection of party leaders, for example by voting on party leadership at a party conferenceBecause the leader of a major party is a powerful and visible person, many party leaders are well-known career politicians",1
"Party leaders can be sufficiently prominent that  they affect voters' perceptions of the entire party, and some voters decide how to vote in elections partly based on how much they like the leaders of the different parties.The number of people involved in choosing party leaders varies widely across parties and across countriesOn one extreme, party leaders might be selected from the entire electorate; on the opposite extreme, they might be selected by just one individual",1
"Selection by a smaller group can be a feature of party leadership transitions in more autocratic countries, where the existence of political parties may be severely constrained to only one legal political party, or only one competitive partySome of these parties, like the Chinese Communist Party, have rigid methods for selecting the next party leader, which involves selection by other party membersA small number of single-party states have hereditary succession, where party leadership is inherited by the child of an outgoing party leader",1
"Autocratic parties use more restrictive selection methods to avoid having major shifts in the regime as a result of successions    Party executives   In both democratic and non-democratic countries, the party leader is often the foremost member of a larger party leadershipA party executive will commonly include administrative positions, like a party secretary and a party chair, who may be different people from the party leaderThese executive organizations may serve to constrain the party leader, especially if that leader is an autocrat",1
"It is common for political parties to conduct major leadership decisions, like selecting a party executive and setting their policy goals, during regular party conferences Much as party leaders who are not in power are usually at least nominally competing to become the head of government, the entire party executive may be competing for various positions in the governmentFor example, in Westminster systems, the largest party that is out of power will form the Official Opposition in parliament, and select a shadow cabinet which (among other functions) provides a signal about which members of the party would hold which positions in the government if the party were to win an election",1
"    Party membership   Citizens in a democracy will often affiliate with a specific political partyParty membership may include paying dues, an agreement not to affiliate with multiple parties at the same time, and sometimes a statement of agreement with the party's policies and platformIn democratic countries, members of political parties often are allowed to participate in elections to choose the party leadershipParty members may form the base of the volunteer activists and donors who support political parties during campaigns",1
"The extent of participation in party organizations can be affected by a country's political institutions, with certain electoral systems and party systems encouraging higher party membershipSince at least the 1980s, membership in large traditional party organizations has been steadily declining across a number of countries, particularly longstanding European democracies    Types of party organizations   Political scientists have distinguished between different types of political parties that have evolved throughout historyThese include cadre parties, mass parties, catch-all parties and cartel parties.: 163–178  Cadre parties were political elites that were concerned with contesting elections and restricted the influence of outsiders, who were only required to assist in election campaigns",1
"Mass parties tried to recruit new members who were a source of party income and were often expected to spread party ideology as well as assist in electionsIn the United States, where both major parties were cadre parties, the introduction of primaries and other reforms has transformed them so that power is held by activists who compete over influence and nomination of candidates    Cadre parties    A cadre party, or elite party, is a type of political party that was dominant in the nineteenth century before the introduction of universal suffrage",1
"The French political scientist Maurice Duverger first distinguished between ""cadre"" and ""mass"" parties, founding his distinction on the differences within the organisational structures of these two types.: 60–71  Cadre parties are characterized by minimal and loose organisation, and are financed by fewer larger monetary contributions typically originating from outside the partyCadre parties give little priority to expanding the party's membership base, and its leaders are its only members.: 165  The earliest political parties, such as the Democratic-Republicans and the Federalists, are classified as cadre parties",1
"    Mass parties    A mass party is a type of political party that developed around cleavages in society and mobilized the ordinary citizens or 'masses' in the political process In Europe, the introduction of universal suffrage resulted in the creation of worker's parties that later evolved into mass parties; an example is the German Social Democratic Party.: 165  These parties represented large groups of citizens who had not previously been represented in political processes, articulating the interests of different groups in society",1
"In contrast to cadre parties, mass parties are funded by their members, and rely on and maintain a large membership baseFurther, mass parties prioritize the mobilization of voters and are more centralized than cadre parties    Catch-all parties    The term ""catch-all party"" was developed by German-American political scientist Otto Kirchheimer to describe the parties that developed in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of changes within the mass parties.: 165  The term ""big tent party"" may be used interchangeably",1
"Kirchheimer characterized the shift from the traditional mass parties to catch-all parties as a set of developments including the ""drastic reduction of the party's ideological baggage"" and the ""downgrading of the role of the individual party member""By broadening their central ideologies into more open-ended ones, catch-all parties seek to secure the support of a wider section of the populationFurther, the role of members is reduced as catch-all parties are financed in part by the state or by donations.: 163–178  In Europe, the shift of Christian Democratic parties that were organized around religion into broader centre-right parties epitomizes this type",1
"    Cartel parties    Cartel parties are a type of political party that emerged post-1970s and are characterized by heavy state financing and the diminished role of ideology as an organizing principleThe cartel party thesis was developed by Richard Katz and Peter Mair, who wrote that political parties have turned into ""semi-state agencies"", acting on behalf of the state rather than groups in societyThe term 'cartel' refers to the way in which prominent parties in government make it difficult for new parties to enter, as such forming a cartel of established parties",1
"As with catch-all parties, the role of members in cartel parties is largely insignificant as parties use the resources of the state to maintain their position within the political system.: 163–178      Niche parties    Niche parties are a type of political party that developed on the basis of the emergence of new cleavages and issues in politics, such as immigration and the environmentIn contrast to mainstream or catch-all parties, niche parties articulate an often limited set of interests in a way that does not conform to the dominant economic left-right divide in politics, in turn emphasising issues that do not attain prominence within the other parties",1
"Further, niche parties do not respond to changes in public opinion to the extent that mainstream parties doExamples of niche parties include Green parties and extreme nationalist parties, such as the Front National in FranceHowever, over time these parties may lose some of their niche qualities, instead adopting those of mainstream parties, for example after entering government    Entrepreneurial parties    An Entrepreneurial party is a political party that is centered on a political entrepreneur, and dedicated to the advancement of that person or their policies",1
"While some definitions of political parties state that a party is an organization that advances a specific set of ideological or policy goals, many political parties are not primarily motivated by ideology or policy, and instead exist to advance the career of a specific political entrepreneur    Party positions and ideologies       Ideological roles and types    Political ideologies are one of the major organizing features of political parties, and parties often officially align themselves with specific ideologies",1
"Parties adopt ideologies for a number of reasonsIdeological affiliations for political parties send signals about the types of policies they might pursue if they were in powerIdeologies also differentiate parties from one another, so that voters can select the party that advances the policies that they most preferA party may also seek to advance an ideology by convincing voters to adopt its belief system.Common ideologies that can form a central part of the identity of a political party include liberalism, conservatism, socialism, communism, anarchism, fascism, feminism, environmentalism, nationalism, fundamentalism, Islamism, and multiculturalism",1
"Liberalism is the ideology that is most closely connected to the history of democracies and is often considered to be the dominant or default ideology of governing parties in much of the contemporary worldMany of the traditional competitors to liberal parties are conservative partiesSocialist, communist, anarchist, fascist, and nationalist parties are more recent developments, largely entering political competitions only in the 19th and 20th centuriesFeminism, environmentalism, multiculturalism, and certain types of fundamentalism became prominent towards the end of the 20th century.Parties can sometimes be organized according to their ideology using an economic left–right political spectrum",1
"However, a simple left-right economic axis does not fully capture the variation in party ideologiesOther common axes that are used to compare the ideologies of political parties include ranges from liberal to authoritarian, from pro-establishment to anti-establishment, and from tolerant and pluralistic (in their behavior while participating in the political arena) to anti-system    Non-ideological parties   Though ideologies are central to a large number of political parties around the world, not all political parties have an organizing ideology, or exist to promote ideological policies",1
"For example, some political parties may be clientelistic or patronage-based organizations, which are largely concerned with distributing goodsOther political parties may be created as tools for the advancement of an individual politicianIt is also common, in countries with important social cleavages along ethnic or racial lines, to represent the interests of one ethnic group or anotherThis may involve a non-ideological attachment to the interests of that group, or may be a commitment based on an ideology like identity politics",1
"While any of these types of parties may be ideological, there are political parties that do not have any organizing ideology    Party systems    Political parties are ubiquitous across both democratic and autocratic countries, and there is often very little change in which political parties have a chance of holding power in a country from one election to the nextThis makes it possible to think about the political parties in a country as collectively forming one of the country's central political institutions, called a party system",1
"Some basic features of a party system are the number of parties and what sorts of parties are the most successfulThese properties are closely connected to other major features of the country's politics, such as how democratic it is, what sorts of restrictions its laws impose on political parties, and what type of electoral systems it usesEven in countries where the number of political parties is not officially constrained by law, political institutions affect how many parties are viable",1
"For example, democracies that use a single-member district electoral system tend to have very few parties, whereas countries that use proportional representation tend to have more.: ch7  The number of parties in a country can also be accurately estimated based on the magnitude of a country's electoral districts and the number of seats in its legislature.: 255 An informative way to classify the party systems of the world is by how many parties they include",1
"Because some party systems include a large number of parties that have a very low probability of winning elections, it is often useful to think about the effective number of parties (the number of parties weighted by the strength of those parties) rather than the literal number of registered parties    Non-partisan systems    In a non-partisan system, no political parties exist, or political parties are not a major part of the political system",1
"There are very few countries without political parties.In some non-partisan countries, the formation of parties is explicitly banned by lawThe existence of political parties may be banned in autocratic countries in order to prevent a turnover in powerFor example, in Saudi Arabia, a ban on political parties has been used as a tool for protecting the monarchyHowever, parties are also banned in some polities that have long democratic histories, usually in local or regional elections of countries that have strong national party systems.Political parties may also temporarily cease to exist in countries that have either only been established recently, or that have experienced a major upheaval in their politics and have not yet returned to a stable system of political parties",1
"For example, the United States began as a non-partisan democracy, and it evolved a stable system of political parties over the course of many decades.: ch.4  A country's party system may also dissolve and take time to re-form, leaving a period of minimal or no party system, such as in Peru following the regime of Alberto FujimoriHowever, it is also possible – albeit rare – for countries with no bans on political parties, and which have not experienced a major disruption, to nevertheless have no political parties: there are a small number of pacific island democracies, such as Palau, where political parties are permitted to exist and yet parties are not an important part of national politics",1
"    One-party systems    In a one-party system, power is held entirely by one political partyWhen only one political party exists, it may be the result of a ban on the formation of any competing political parties, which is a common feature in authoritarian statesFor example, the Communist Party of Cuba is the only permitted political party in Cuba, and is the only party that can hold seats in the legislatureWhen only one powerful party is legally permitted to exist, its membership can grow to contain a very large portion of society and it can play substantial roles in civil society that are not necessarily directly related to political governance; one example of this is the Chinese Communist Party",1
"Bans on competing parties can also ensure that only one party can ever realistically hold power, even without completely outlawing all other political partiesFor example, in North Korea, more than one party is officially permitted to exist and even to seat members in the legislature, but laws ensure that the Workers' Party of Korea retains control.It is also possible for countries with free elections to have only one party that holds power",1
"These cases are sometimes called dominant-party systems or particraciesScholars have debated whether or not a country that has never experienced a transfer of power from one party to another can nevertheless be considered a democracy.: 23  There have been periods of government exclusively or entirely by one party in some countries that are often considered to have been democratic, and which had no official legal barriers to the inclusion of other parties in the government; this includes recent periods in Botswana, Japan, Mexico, Senegal, and South Africa.: 24–27  It can also occur that one political party dominates a sub-national region of a democratic country that has a competitive national party system; one example is the southern United States during much of the 19th and 20th centuries, where the Democratic Party had almost complete control, with the Southern states being functionally one-party regimes, though opposition parties were never prohibited",1
"    Two-party systems    In several countries, there are only two parties that have a realistic chance of competing to form governmentOne canonical two-party democracy is the United States, where the national government has for much of the country's history exclusively controlled by either the Democratic Party and the Republican PartyOther examples of countries which have had long periods of two-party dominance include Colombia, Uruguay, Malta, and GhanaTwo-party systems are not limited to democracies; they may be present in authoritarian regimes as well",1
"Competition between two parties has occurred in historical autocratic regimes in countries including Brazil and Venezuela.A democracy's political institutions can shape the number of parties that it hasIn the 1950s Maurice Duverger observed that single-member district single-vote plurality-rule elections tend to produce two-party systems,: 217  and this phenomenon came to be known as Duverger's lawWhether or not this pattern is true has been heavily debated over the last several decades",1
"Some political scientists have broadened this idea to argue that more restrictive political institutions (of which first past the post is one example) tend to produce a smaller number of political parties, so that extremely small parties systems — like those with only two parties — tend to form in countries with very restrictive rules.Two-party systems have attracted heavy criticism for limiting the choices that electors have, and much of this criticism has centered around their association with restrictive political institutions",1
"For example, some commentators argue that political institutions in prominent two-party systems like the United States have been specifically designed to ensure that no third party can become competitiveCriticisms also center around these systems' tendencies to encourage insincere voting and to facilitate the spoiler effect.: ch1      Multi-party systems    Multi-party systems are systems in which more than two parties have a realistic chance of holding power and influencing policyA very large number of systems around the world have had periods of multi-party competition, and two-party democracies may be considered unusual or uncommon compared to multi-party systems",1
"Many of the largest democracies in the world have had long periods of multi-party competition, including India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and BrazilMulti-party systems encourage characteristically different types of governance than smaller party systems, for example by often encouraging the formation of coalition governments.The presence of many competing political parties is usually associated with a greater level of democracy, and a country transitioning from having a one-party system to having a many-party system is often considered to be democratizing",1
"Authoritarian countries can include multi-party competition, but typically this occurs when the elections are not fairFor this reason, in two-party democracies like the United States, proponents of forming new competitive political parties often argue that developing a multi-party system would make the country more democraticHowever, the question of whether multi-party systems are more democratic than two-party systems, or if they enjoy better policy outcomes, is a subject of substantial disagreement among scholars as well as among the public",1
"In the opposite extreme, a country with a very large number of parties can experience governing coalitions that include highly ideologically diverse parties that are unable to make much policy progress, which may cause the country to be unstable and experience a very large number of elections; examples of systems that have been described as having these problems include periods in the recent history of Israel, Italy, and FinlandMulti-party systems are often viewed as fairer or more representative than one- or two-party systems, but they also have downsides, like the likelihood that in a system with plurality voting the winner of a race with many options will only have minority support.Some multi-party systems may have two parties that are noticeably more competitive than the other parties",1
"Such party systems have been called ""two-party-plus"" systems, which refers to the two dominant parties, plus other parties that exist but rarely or never hold power in the governmentIt is also possible for very large multi-party systems, like India's, to nevertheless be characterized largely by a series of regional contests that realistically have only two competitive parties, but in the aggregate can produce many more than 2 parties that have major roles in the country's national politics",1
"    Funding    Many of the activities of political parties involve the acquisition and allocation of funds in order to achieve political goalsThe funding involved can be very substantial, with contemporary elections in the largest democracies typically costing billions or even tens of billions of dollarsMuch of this expense is paid by candidates and political parties, which often develop sophisticated fundraising organizationsBecause paying for participation in electoral contests is such a central democratic activity, the funding of political parties is an important feature of a country's politics",1
"    Sources of party funds    Common sources of party funding across countries include dues-paying party members, advocacy groups and lobbying organizations, corporations, trade unions, and candidates who may self-fund activitiesIn most countries, the government also provides some level of funding for political partiesNearly all of the 180 countries examined by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance have some form of public funding for political parties, and about a third have regular payments of government funds that goes beyond campaign reimbursements",1
"In some countries, public funding for parties depends on the size of that party: for example, a country may only provide funding to parties which have more than a certain number of candidates or supportersA common argument for public funding of political parties is that it creates fairer and more democratic elections by enabling more groups to compete, whereas many advocates for private funding of parties argue that donations to parties are a form of political expression that should be protected in a democracy",1
"Public financing of political parties may decrease parties' pursuit of funds through corrupt methods, by decreasing their incentive to find alternate sources of funding.One way of categorizing the sources of party funding is between public funding and private fundingAnother dichotomy is between plutocratic and grassroots sources; parties which get much of their funding from large corporations may tend to pursue different policies and use different strategies than parties which are mostly funded through small donations by individual supporters",1
"Private funding for political parties can also be thought of as coming from internal or external sources: this distinguishes between dues from party members or contributions by candidates, and donations from entities outside of the party like non-members, corporations, or trade unionsInternal funding may be preferred because external sources might make the party beholden to an outside entity    Uses for party funds   There are many ways in which political parties may deploy money in order to secure better electoral outcomes",1
"Parties often spend money to train activists, recruit volunteers, create and deploy advertisements, conduct research and support for their leadership in between elections, and promote their policy agendaMany political parties and candidates engage in a practice called clientelism, in which they distribute material rewards to people in exchange for political support; in many countries this is illegal, though even where it is illegal it may nevertheless be widespread in practiceSome parties engage directly in vote buying, in which a party gives money to a person in exchange for their vote.Though it may be crucial for a party to spend more than some threshold to win a given election, there are typically diminishing returns for expenses during a campaign",1
"Once a party has crossed a particular spending threshold, additional expenditures might not increase their chance of success    Restrictions   Fundraising and expenditures by political parties are typically regulated by governments, with many countries' regulations focusing on who can contribute money to parties, how parties' money can be spent, and how much of it can pass through the hands of a political partyTwo main ways in which regulations affect parties are by intervening in their sources of income and by mandating that they maintain some level of transparency about their funding",1
"One common type of restriction on how parties acquire money is to limit who can donate money to political parties; for example, people who are not citizens of a country may not be allowed to make contributions to that country's political parties, in order to prevent foreign interferenceIt is also common to limit how much money an individual can give to a political party each electionSimilarly, many governments cap the total amount of money that can be spent by each party in an election",1
"Transparency regulations may require parties to disclose detailed financial information to the government, and in many countries transparency laws require those disclosures to be available to the public, as a safeguard against potential corruptionCreating, implementing, and amending laws regarding party expenses can be extremely difficult, since governments may be controlled by the very parties that these regulations restrict    Party colours and symbols    Nearly all political parties associate themselves with specific colours and symbols, primarily to aid voters in identifying, recognizing, and remembering the party",1
"This branding is particularly important in polities where much of the population may be illiterate, so that someone who cannot read a party's name on a ballot can instead identify that party by colour or logoParties of similar ideologies will often use the same colours across different countriesColour associations are useful as a short-hand for referring to and representing parties in graphical mediaThey can also be used to refer to coalitions and alliances between political parties and other organizations; examples include purple alliances, red-green alliances, traffic light coalitions, pan-green coalitions, and pan-blue coalitions",1
"However, associations between colour and ideology can also be inconsistent: parties of the same ideology in different countries often use different colours, and sometimes competing parties in a country may even adopt the same coloursThese associations also have major exceptionsFor example, in the United States, red is associated with the more conservative Republican Party while blue is associated with the more left-leaning Democratic Party    See also   List of largest political parties List of ruling political parties by country Lists of political parties by country     References  ",1
"Political science is the scientific study of politicsIt is a social science dealing with systems of governance and power, and the analysis of political activities, political thought, political behavior, and associated constitutions and laws.Modern political science can generally be divided into the three subdisciplines of comparative politics, international relations, and political theoryOther notable subdisciplines are public policy and administration, domestic politics and government (often studied within comparative politics), political economy, and political methodology",1
"Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of economics, law, sociology, history, philosophy, human geography, journalism, political anthropology, psychology, and social policyPolitical science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in psychology, social research, and cognitive neuroscienceApproaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational choice theory, behaviouralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism, institutionalism, and pluralismPolitical science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources, such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources, such as scholarly journal articles, survey research, statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research, and model building",1
"    History       Origins   As a social political science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th centuryAt that time it began to separate itself from political philosophy, which traces its roots back to the works of Aristotle and Plato, which were written nearly 2,500 years agoThe term ""political science"" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state",1
"The advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th centuryIn fact, the designation ""political scientist"" is typically for those with a doctorate in the field, but can also apply to those with a master's in the subjectIntegrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both normative and positive political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors",1
"The American Political Science Association and the American Political Science Review were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomenaThe journal Political Science Quarterly was established in 1886 by the Academy of Political ScienceIn the inaugural issue of Political Science Quarterly, Munroe Smith defined political science as ""the science of the stateTaken in this sense, it includes the organization and functions of the state, and the relation of states one to another.""     Behavioural revolution and new institutionalism   In the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioral revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behavior swept the discipline",1
"A focus on studying political behavior, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioral political science, including work by Robert Dahl, Philip Converse, and in the collaboration between sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld and public opinion scholar Bernard BerelsonThe late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a takeoff in the use of deductive, game-theoretic formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the disciplineThis period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the United States Congress, as well as political behavior, such as voting",1
"William HRiker and his colleagues and students at the University of Rochester were the main proponents of this shiftDespite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all the kinds of scholarship discussed above, it has been observed that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven    Recent developments   In 2000, the Perestroika Movement in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science",1
"Those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of itSome evolutionary psychology theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politicsHowever, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world",1
"This is argued to explain many important features and systematic cognitive biases of current politics    Overview   Political science is a social study concerning the allocation and transfer of power in decision making, the roles and systems of governance including governments and international organizations, political behaviour, and public policiesIt measures the success of governance and specific policies by examining many factors, including stability, justice, material wealth, peace, and public healthSome political scientists seek to advance positive theses (which attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) by analysing politics; others advance normative theses, such as by making specific policy recommendations",1
"The study of politics and policies can be closely connected—for example, in comparative analyses of which types of political institutions tend to produce certain types of policiesPolitical science provides analysis and predictions about political and governmental issuesPolitical scientists examine the processes, systems and political dynamics of countries and regions of the world, often to raise public awareness or to influence specific governmentsPolitical scientists may provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the electorate analyze issues",1
"According to Chaturvedy,  Political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselvesPolitical scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties, or as civil servantsThey may be involved with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or political movementsIn a variety of capacities, people educated and trained in political science can add value and expertise to corporationsPrivate enterprises such as think tanks, research institutes, polling and public relations firms often employ political scientists",1
"    Country-specific studies   Political scientists may study political phenomena within one specific country; for example, they may study just the politics of the United States or just the politics of China.In the case of the United States, political scientists known as ""Americanists"" look at a variety of data, including constitutional development, elections, public opinion, and public policy, such as Social Security reform, foreign policy, US Congressional committees, and the US Supreme CourtPolitical scientists will often focus on the politics of their own country; for example, a political scientist from Indonesia may become an expert in the politics of Indonesia",1
"    Anticipating crises   The theory of political transitions, and the methods of analyzing and anticipating crises, form an important part of political scienceSeveral general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitionsAmong them, one statistical indicator of crisis, a simultaneous increase of variance and correlations in large groups, was proposed for crisis anticipation and may be successfully used in various areasIts applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 Ukrainian economic and political crisis",1
"There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis yearsA feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predictedThe theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.The study of major crises, both political crises and external crises that can affect politics, is not limited to attempts to predict regime transitions or major changes in political institutions",1
"Political scientists also study how governments handle unexpected disasters, and how voters in democracies react to their governments' preparations for and responses to crises    Cognate fields   Most political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas:  Political philosophy or political theory Public administration Public law Public policy Program evaluationProgram evaluation is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies, and programs, particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency",1
"In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving, or objecting to are producing the intended effectWhile program evaluation first focuses on this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, whether there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.Policy analysis is a technique used in public administration to enable civil servants, activists, and others to examine and evaluate the available options to implement the goals of laws and elected officials",1
"    Subfields of political science   Many political scientists conduct research in one of four areas, described below: Political Philosophy: Concerned with the foundations of political community and institutions, while focusing on human nature and the moral purposes of political associationComparative Politics: Compares contemporary political systems and discovers general laws and theoriesInternational Relations: Concerned with developing an understanding of why states and non-state international actors interactPolitical Methodology: Studies the philosophical bases of social science, political science, empirical research design and analysis.Some political science departments also classify methodology as well as scholarship on the domestic politics of a particular country as distinct fields",1
"In the United States, American politics is often treated as a separate subfieldIn contrast to this traditional classification, some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories, including political philosophy, political behaviour (including public opinion, collective action, and identity), and political institutions (including legislatures and international organizations)Political science conferences and journals often emphasize scholarship in more specific categoriesThe American Political Science Association, for example, has 42 organized sections that address various methods and topics of political inquiry",1
"    Research methods    Political science is methodologically diverse; political scientists approach the study of politics from a host of different ontological orientations and with a variety of different toolsBecause political science is essentially a study of human behaviour, in all aspects of politics, observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though experimental methods are increasingly common (see experimental political science)Citing this difficulty, former American Political Science Association President Lawrence Lowell once said ""We are limited by the impossibility of experiment",1
"Politics is an observational, not an experimental science."" Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politicsLike all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices, unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in biology or inanimate objects as in physics",1
"Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics, and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political scienceEmpirical political science methods include the use of field experiments, surveys and survey experiments, case studies, process tracing, historical and institutional analysis, ethnography, participant observation, and interview research.Political scientists also use and develop theoretical tools like game theory and agent-based models to study a host of political systems and situations.Political theorists approach theories of political phenomena with a similar diversity of positions and tools, including feminist political theory, historical analysis associated with the Cambridge school, and Straussian approaches",1
"Political science may overlap with topics of study that are the traditional focuses of other social sciences—for example, when sociological norms or psychological biases are connected to political phenomenaIn these cases, political science may either inherit their methods of study or develop a contrasting approachFor example, Lisa Wedeen has argued that political science's approach to the idea of culture, originating with Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba and exemplified by authors like Samuel P",1
"Huntington, could benefit from aligning more closely with the study of culture in anthropologyIn turn, methodologies that are developed within political science may influence how researchers in other fields, like public health, conceive of and approach political processes and policies    Education   Political science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, can be described ""as a discipline lives on the fault line between the 'two cultures' in the academy, the sciences and the humanities."" Thus, in some American colleges where there is no separate school or college of arts and sciences per se, political science may be a separate department housed as part of a division or school of humanities or liberal arts",1
"Whereas classical political philosophy is primarily defined by a concern for Hellenic and Enlightenment thought, political scientists are also marked by a great concern for ""modernity"" and the contemporary nation state, along with the study of classical thought, and as such share more terminology with sociologists (e.g., structure and agency)Most United States colleges and universities offer BA programs in political scienceMA or MAT and PhD or EdD programs are common at larger universities",1
"The term political science is more popular in North America than elsewhere; other institutions, especially those outside the United States, see political science as part of a broader discipline of political studies, politics, or governmentWhile political science implies the use of the scientific method, political studies implies a broader approach, although the naming of degree courses does not necessarily reflect their contentSeparate programs (often professional degrees) in international relations and public policy are not uncommon at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels",1
"Master's-level programs in public administration are professional degrees covering public policy along with other applied subjects; they are often seen as more linked to politics than any other discipline, which may be reflected by being housed in that department.The national honor society for college and university students of government and politics in the United States is Pi Sigma Alpha    Writing in political science   There are different genres of writings in political sciences; including but not limited to: Argument essays and Research papers Political theory writing Responses to articles, texts, events thoughts and reflective papersThe most common piece of writing in political sciences are research papers, which investigate an original research question",1

"A political spectrum is a system to characterize and classify different political positions in relation to one anotherThese positions sit upon one or more geometric axes that represent independent political dimensionsThe expressions political compass and political map are used to refer to the political spectrum as well, especially to popular two-dimensional models of it.Most long-standing spectra include the left–right dimension which originally referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament after the Revolution (1789–1799), with radicals on the left and aristocrats on the right",1
"While communism and socialism are usually regarded internationally as being on the left, conservatism and reactionism are generally regarded as being on the rightLiberalism can mean different things in different contexts, being sometimes on the left (social liberalism) and other times on the right (conservative liberalism or classical liberalism)Those with an intermediate outlook are sometimes classified as centristsPolitics that rejects the conventional left–right spectrum is often known as syncretic politics, although the label tends to mischaracterize positions that have a logical location on a two-axis spectrum because they seem randomly brought together on a one-axis left–right spectrum",1
"Political scientists have frequently noted that a single left–right axis is too simplistic and insufficient for describing the existing variation in political beliefs and included other axesAlthough the descriptive words at polar opposites may vary, the axes of popular biaxial spectra are usually split between economic issues (on a left–right dimension) and socio-cultural issues (on an authority–liberty dimension)    Historical origin of the terms   The terms right and left refer to political affiliations originating early in the French Revolutionary era of 1789–1799 and referred originally to the seating arrangements in the various legislative bodies of France",1
"As seen from the Speaker's seat at the front of the Assembly, the aristocracy sat on the right (traditionally the seat of honor) and the commoners sat on the left, hence the terms right-wing politics and left-wing politics.Originally, the defining point on the ideological spectrum was the Ancien Régime (""old order"")""The Right"" thus implied support for aristocratic or royal interests and the church, while ""The Left"" implied support for republicanism, secularism and civil liberties",1
"Because the political franchise at the start of the revolution was relatively narrow, the original ""Left"" represented mainly the interests of the bourgeoisie, the rising capitalist class (with notable exceptions such as the proto-communist Gracchus Babeuf)Support for laissez-faire commerce and free markets were expressed by politicians sitting on the left because these represented policies favorable to capitalists rather than to the aristocracy, but outside parliamentary politics these views are often characterized as being on the Right",1
"The reason for this apparent contradiction lies in the fact that those ""to the left"" of the parliamentary left, outside official parliamentary structures (such as the sans-culottes of the French Revolution), typically represent much of the working class, poor peasantry and the unemployedTheir political interests in the French Revolution lay with opposition to the aristocracy and so they found themselves allied with the early capitalistsHowever, this did not mean that their economic interests lay with the laissez-faire policies of those representing them politically",1
"As capitalist economies developed, the aristocracy became less relevant and were mostly replaced by capitalist representativesThe size of the working class increased as capitalism expanded and began to find expression partly through trade unionist, socialist, anarchist and communist politics rather than being confined to the capitalist policies expressed by the original ""left""This evolution has often pulled parliamentary politicians away from laissez-faire economic policies, although this has happened to different degrees in different countries, especially those with a history of issues with more authoritarian-left countries, such as the Soviet Union or China under Mao Zedong",1
"Thus, the word ""Left"" in American political parlance may refer to ""liberalism"" and be identified with the Democratic Party, whereas in a country such as France these positions would be regarded as relatively more right-wing, or centrist overall, and ""left"" is more likely to refer to ""socialist"" or ""social-democratic"" positioned  rather than ""liberal"" ones    Academic investigation   For almost a century, social scientists have considered the problem of how to best describe political variation",1
"    Leonard WFerguson   In 1950, Leonard WFerguson analyzed political values using ten scales measuring attitudes toward: birth control, capital punishment, censorship, communism, evolution, law, patriotism, theism, treatment of criminals and warSubmitting the results to factor analysis, he was able to identify three factors, which he named religionism, humanitarianism and nationalismHe defined religionism as belief in God and negative attitudes toward evolution and birth control; humanitarianism as being related to attitudes opposing war, capital punishment and harsh treatment of criminals; and nationalism as describing variation in opinions on censorship, law, patriotism and communism",1
"This system was derived empirically, as rather than devising a political model on purely theoretical grounds and testing it, Ferguson's research was exploratoryAs a result of this method, care must be taken in the interpretation of Ferguson's three factors, as factor analysis will output an abstract factor whether an objectively real factor exists or notAlthough replication of the nationalism factor was inconsistent, the finding of religionism and humanitarianism had a number of replications by Ferguson and others",1
"    Hans Eysenck    Shortly afterward, Hans Eysenck began researching political attitudes in the United KingdomHe believed that there was something essentially similar about the National Socialists (Nazis) on the one hand and the communists on the other, despite their opposite positions on the left–right axisAs Hans Eysenck described in his 1956 book Sense and Nonsense in Psychology, Eysenck compiled a list of political statements found in newspapers and political tracts and asked subjects to rate their agreement or disagreement with each",1
"Submitting this value questionnaire to the same process of factor analysis used by Ferguson, Eysenck drew out two factors, which he named ""Radicalism"" (R-factor) and ""Tender-Mindedness"" (T-factor)Such analysis produces a factor whether or not it corresponds to a real-world phenomenon and so caution must be exercised in its interpretationWhile Eysenck's R-factor is easily identified as the classical ""left–right"" dimension, the T-factor (representing a factor drawn at right angles to the R-factor) is less intuitive, as high-scorers favored pacifism, racial equality, religious education and restrictions on abortion, while low-scorers had attitudes more friendly to militarism, harsh punishment, easier divorce laws and companionate marriage",1
"According to social scientist Bojan Todosijevic, radicalism was defined as positively viewing evolution theory, strikes, welfare state, mixed marriages, student protests, law reform, women's liberation, United Nations, nudist camps, pop-music, modern art, immigration, abolishing private property, and rejection of patriotismConservatism was defined as positively viewing white superiority, birching, death penalty, anti-Semitism, opposition to nationalization of property, and birth controlTender-mindedness was defined by moral training, inborn conscience, Bible truth, chastity, self-denial, pacifism, anti-discrimination, being against the death penalty, and harsh treatment of criminals",1
"Tough-mindedness was defined by compulsory sterilization, euthanasia, easier divorce laws, racism, anti-Semitism, compulsory military training, wife swapping, casual living, death penalty, and harsh treatment of criminalsDespite the difference in methodology, location and theory, the results attained by Eysenck and Ferguson matchedSimply rotating Eysenck's two factors 45 degrees renders the same factors of religionism and humanitarianism identified by Ferguson in America.Eysenck's dimensions of R and T were found by factor analyses of values in Germany and Sweden, France and Japan.One interesting result Eysenck noted in his 1956 work was that in the United States and the United Kingdom, most of the political variance was subsumed by the left/right axis, while in France the T-axis was larger and in the Middle East the only dimension to be found was the T-axis: ""Among mid-Eastern Arabs it has been found that while the tough-minded/tender-minded dimension is still clearly expressed in the relationships observed between different attitudes, there is nothing that corresponds to the radical-conservative continuum""",1
"     Relationship between Eysenck's political views and political research    Eysenck's political views related to his research: Eysenck was an outspoken opponent of what he perceived as the authoritarian abuses of the left and right and accordingly he believed that with this T axis he had found the link between nazism and communismAccording to Eysenck, members of both ideologies were tough-mindedCentral to Eysenck's thesis was the claim that tender-minded ideologies were democratic and friendly to human freedoms, while tough-minded ideologies were aggressive and authoritarian, a claim that is open to political criticism",1
"In this context, Eysenck carried out studies on nazism and communist groups, claiming to find members of both groups to be more ""dominant"" and more ""aggressive"" than control groups.Eysenck left Nazi Germany to live in Britain and was not shy in attacking Stalinism, noting the anti-Semitic prejudices of the Russian government, the luxurious lifestyles of the Soviet Union leadership and the Orwellian ""doublethink"" of East Germany's naming itself the German Democratic Republic despite being ""one of the most undemocratic regimes in the world today""",1
"While Eysenck was an opponent of Nazism, his relationship with fascist organizations was more complexEysenck himself lent theoretical support to the English National Party (which also opposed ""Hitlerite"" Nazism) and was interviewed in the first issue of their journal The Beacon in relation to his controversial views on relative intelligence between different racesAt one point during the interview, Eysenck was asked whether or not he was of Jewish origin before the interviewer proceeded",1
"His political allegiances were called into question by other researchers, notably Steven Rose, who alleged that his scientific research was used for political purposes     Subsequent criticism of Eysenck's research    Eysenck's conception of tough-mindedness has been criticized for a number of reasons Virtually no values were found to load only on the tough/tender dimensionThe interpretation of tough-mindedness as a manifestation of ""authoritarian"" versus tender-minded ""democratic"" values was incompatible with the Frankfurt School's single-axis model, which conceptualized authoritarianism as being a fundamental manifestation of conservatism and many researchers took issue with the idea of ""left-wing authoritarianism""",1
"The theory which Eysenck developed to explain individual variation in the observed dimensions, relating tough-mindedness to extroversion and psychoticism, returned ambiguous research resultsEysenck's finding that Nazis and communists were more tough-minded than members of mainstream political movements was criticised on technical grounds by Milton RokeachEysenck's method of analysis involves the finding of an abstract dimension (a factor) that explains the spread of a given set of data (in this case, scores on a political survey)",1
"This abstract dimension may or may not correspond to a real material phenomenon and obvious problems arise when it is applied to human psychologyThe second factor in such an analysis (such as Eysenck's T-factor) is the second best explanation for the spread of the data, which is by definition drawn at right angles to the first factorWhile the first factor, which describes the bulk of the variation in a set of data, is more likely to represent something objectively real, subsequent factors become more and more abstract",1
"Thus one would expect to find a factor that roughly corresponds to ""left"" and ""right"", as this is the dominant framing for politics in our society, but the basis of Eysenck's ""tough/tender-minded"" thesis (the second, T-factor) may well represent nothing beyond an abstract mathematical constructSuch a construct would be expected to appear in factor analysis whether or not it corresponded to something real, thus rendering Eysenck's thesis unfalsifiable through factor analysis",1
"    Milton Rokeach   Dissatisfied with Hans JEysenck's work, Milton Rokeach developed his own two-axis model of political values in 1973, basing this on the ideas of freedom and equality, which he described in his book, The Nature of Human Values.Rokeach claimed that the defining difference between the left and right was that the left stressed the importance of equality more than the rightDespite his criticisms of Eysenck's tough–tender axis, Rokeach also postulated a basic similarity between communism and Nazism, claiming that these groups would not value freedom as greatly as more conventional social democrats, democratic socialists and capitalists would and he wrote that ""the two value model presented here most resembles Eysenck's hypothesis"".To test this model, Rokeach and his colleagues used content analysis on works exemplifying Nazism (written by Adolf Hitler), communism (written by Vladimir Lenin), capitalism (by Barry Goldwater) and socialism (written by various authors)",1
"This method has been criticized for its reliance on the experimenter's familiarity with the content under analysis and its dependence on the researcher's particular political outlooksMultiple raters made frequency counts of sentences containing synonyms for a number of values identified by Rokeach—including freedom and equality—and Rokeach analyzed these results by comparing the relative frequency rankings of all the values for each of the four texts:  Socialists (socialism) — freedom ranked 1st, equality ranked 2nd Hitler (Nazism) – freedom ranked 16th, equality ranked 17th Goldwater (capitalism) — freedom ranked 1st, equality ranked 16th Lenin (communism) — freedom ranked 17th, equality ranked 1stLater studies using samples of American ideologues and American presidential inaugural addresses attempted to apply this model",1
"    Later research   In further research, Eysenck refined his methodology to include more questions on economic issuesDoing this, he revealed a split in the left–right axis between social policy and economic policy, with a previously undiscovered dimension of socialism-capitalism (S-factor)While factorially distinct from Eysenck's previous R factor, the S-factor did positively correlate with the R-factor, indicating that a basic left–right or right–left tendency underlies both social values and economic values, although S tapped more into items discussing economic inequality and big business, while R relates more to the treatment of criminals and to sexual issues and military issues",1
"Most research and political theory since this time has replicated the factors shown above.Another replication came from Ronald Inglehart's research into national opinions based on the World Values Survey, although Inglehart's research described the values of countries rather than individuals or groups of individuals within nationsInglehart's two-factor solution took the form of Ferguson's original religionism and humanitarianism dimensions; Inglehart labelled them ""secularism–traditionalism"", which covered issues of tradition and religion, like patriotism, abortion, euthanasia and the importance of obeying the law and authority figures, and ""survivalism – self expression"", which measured issues like everyday conduct and dress, acceptance of diversity (including foreigners) and innovation and attitudes towards people with specific controversial lifestyles such as homosexuality and vegetarianism, as well as willingness to engage in political activism",1
"See for Inglehart's national chartThough not directly related to Eysenck's research, evidence suggests there may be as many as 6 dimensions of political opinions in the United States and 10 dimensions in the United KingdomThis conclusion was based on two large datasets and uses a Bayesian approach rather than the traditional factor analysis method    Other double-axis models       Greenberg and Jonas: left–right, ideological rigidity   In a 2003 Psychological Bulletin paper, Jeff Greenberg and Eva Jonas posit a model comprising the standard left–right axis and an axis representing ideological rigidity",1
"For Greenberg and Jonas, ideological rigidity has ""much in common with the related concepts of dogmatism and authoritarianism"" and is characterized by ""believing in strong leaders and submission, preferring one’s own in-group, ethnocentrism and nationalism, aggression against dissidents, and control with the help of police and military""Greenberg and Jonas posit that high ideological rigidity can be motivated by ""particularly strong needs to reduce fear and uncertainty"" and is a primary shared characteristic of ""people who subscribe to any extreme government or ideology, whether it is right-wing or left-wing""",1
"    Inglehart: traditionalist–secular and self expressionist–survivalist    In its 4 January 2003 issue, The Economist discussed a chart, proposed by Ronald Inglehart and supported by the World Values Survey (associated with the University of Michigan), to plot cultural ideology onto two dimensionsOn the y-axis it covered issues of tradition and religion, like patriotism, abortion, euthanasia and the importance of obeying the law and authority figuresAt the bottom of the chart is the traditionalist position on issues like these (with loyalty to country and family and respect for life considered important), while at the top is the secular position",1
"The x-axis deals with self-expression, issues like everyday conduct and dress, acceptance of diversity (including foreigners) and innovation, and attitudes towards people with specific controversial lifestyles such as vegetarianism, as well as willingness to engage in political activismAt the right of the chart is the open self-expressionist position, while at the left is its opposite position, which Inglehart calls survivalistThis chart not only has the power to map the values of individuals, but also to compare the values of people in different countries",1
"Placed on this chart, European Union countries in continental Europe come out on the top right, Anglophone countries on the middle right, Latin American countries on the bottom right, African, Middle Eastern and South Asian countries on the bottom left and ex-Communist countries on the top left    Pournelle: liberty–control, irrationalism–rationalism    This very distinct two-axis model was created by Jerry Pournelle in 1963 for his doctoral dissertation in political scienceThe Pournelle chart has liberty on one axis, with those on the left seeking freedom from control or protections for social deviance and those on the right emphasizing state authority or protections for norm enforcement (farthest right being state worship, farthest left being the idea of a state as the ""ultimate evil"")",1
" The other axis is rationalism, defined here as the belief in planned social progress, with those higher up believing that there are problems with society that can be rationally solved and those lower down skeptical of such approaches    Mitchell: Eight Ways to Run the Country    In 2006, Brian Patrick Mitchell identified four main political traditions in Anglo-American history based on their regard for kratos (defined as the use of force) and archē or ""archy"" (defined as the recognition of rank)",1
"Mitchell grounded the distinction of archy and kratos in the West's historical experience of church and state, crediting the collapse of the Christian consensus on church and state with the appearance of four main divergent traditions in Western political thought: Republican constitutionalism   pro archy, anti kratos Libertarian individualism   anti archy, anti kratos Democratic progressivism   anti archy, pro kratos Plutocratic nationalism   pro archy, pro kratosMitchell charts these traditions graphically using a vertical axis as a scale of kratos/akrateia and a horizontal axis as a scale of archy/anarchy",1
"He places democratic progressivism in the lower left, plutocratic nationalism in the lower right, republican constitutionalism in the upper right, and libertarian individualism in the upper leftThe political left is therefore distinguished by its rejection of archy, while the political right is distinguished by its acceptance of archyFor Mitchell, anarchy is not the absence of government but the rejection of rankThus there can be both anti-government anarchists (Mitchell's ""libertarian individualists"") and pro-government anarchists (Mitchell's ""democratic progressives"", who favor the use of government force against social hierarchies such as patriarchy)",1
"Mitchell also distinguishes between left-wing anarchists and right-wing anarchists, whom Mitchell renames ""akratists"" for their opposition to the government's use of forceFrom the four main political traditions, Mitchell identifies eight distinct political perspectives diverging from a populist centerFour of these perspectives (Progressive, Individualist, Paleoconservative, and Neoconservative) fit squarely within the four traditions; four others (Paleolibertarian, Theoconservative, Communitarian, and Radical) fit between the traditions, being defined by their singular focus on rank or force",1
"    Nolan: economic freedom, personal freedom    The Nolan Chart was created by libertarian David NolanThis chart shows what he considers as ""economic freedom"" (issues like taxation, free trade and free enterprise) on the horizontal axis and what he considers as ""personal freedom"" (issues like drug legalization, abortion and the draft) on the vertical axisThis puts left-wingers in the left quadrant, libertarians in the top, centrists in the middle, right-wingers in the right and what Nolan originally named populists in the bottom",1
" Several popular online tests, where individuals can self-identify their political values, utilize the same two axes as the Nolan Chart, including The Political Compass and iSideWith.com    Spatial model    The spatial model of voting plots voters and candidates in a multi-dimensional space where each dimension represents a single political issue sub-component of an issue, or candidate attribute  Voters are then modeled as having an ""ideal point"" in this space and voting for the nearest candidates to that point",1
"The dimensions of this model can also be assigned to non-political properties of the candidates, such as perceived corruption, health, etc.Most of the other spectra in this article can then be considered projections of this multi-dimensional space onto a smaller number of dimensionsFor example, a study of German voters found that at least four dimensions were required to adequately represent all political parties    Other proposed dimensions    In 1998, political author Virginia Postrel, in her book The Future and Its Enemies, offered another single-axis spectrum that measures views of the future, contrasting stasists, who allegedly fear the future and wish to control it, and dynamists, who want the future to unfold naturally and without attempts to plan and control",1
"The distinction corresponds to the utopian versus dystopian spectrum used in some theoretical assessments of liberalism, and the book's title is borrowed from the work of the anti-utopian classic-liberal theorist Karl PopperIt could also be seen as simply another name for conservatism versus progressivism.Other proposed axes include:  Focus of political concern: communitarianism vsindividualismThese labels are preferred to the loaded language of ""totalitarianism"" (anti-freedom) vs""libertarianism"" (pro-freedom), because one can have a political focus on the community without being totalitarian and undemocratic",1
"Council communism is a political philosophy that would be counted as communitarian on this axis, but is not totalitarian or undemocraticResponses to conflict: according to the political philosopher Charles Blattberg, those who would respond to conflict with conversation should be considered as on the left, with negotiation as in the centre, and with force as on the rightSee his essay ""Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies""Role of the church: clericalism vs",1
"anti-clericalismThis axis is less significant in the United States (where views of the role of religion tend to be subsumed into the general left–right axis) than in Europe (where clericalism versus anti-clericalism is much less correlated with the left–right spectrum)Urban vsrural: this axis is significant today in the politics of Europe, Australia and CanadaThe urban vsrural axis was equally prominent in the United States' political past, but its importance is debatable at present",1
"In the late 18th century and early 19th century in the United States, it would have been described as the conflict between Hamiltonian Federalists and Jeffersonian RepublicansForeign policy: interventionism (the nation should exert power abroad to implement its policy) vsnon-interventionism (the nation should keep to its own affairs)Similarly, multilateralism (coordination of policies with other countries) vsisolationism and unilateralism Geopolitics: relations with individual states or groups of states may also be vital to party politics",1
"During the Cold War, parties often had to choose a position on a scale between pro-American and pro-Soviet Union, although this could at times closely match a left–right spectrumAt other times in history relations with other powerful states has been importantIn early Canadian history relations with Britain were a central theme, although this was not ""foreign policy"" but a debate over the proper place of Canada within the British Empire",1

"    Political-spectrum-based forecasts   As shown by Russian political scientist Stepan SSulakshin, political spectra can be used as a forecasting toolSulakshin offered mathematical evidence that stable development (positive dynamics of the vast number of statistic indices) depends on the width of the political spectrum: if it is too narrow or too wide, stagnation or political disasters will resultSulakshin also showed that in the short run the political spectrum determines the statistic indices dynamic and not vice versa",1
"    Biological variables    A number of studies have found that biology can be linked with political orientationMany of the studies linking biology to politics remain controversial and unreplicated, although the overall body of evidence is growing.Studies have found that subjects with conservative political views have larger amygdalae and are more prone to feeling disgustLiberals have larger volume of grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex and are better at detecting errors in recurring patterns",1
"The anterior cingulate cortex is used when dealing with conflicting informationA study done by researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and New York University (NYU) had participants sort through a deck of cardsThe letter M was 4x more likely to be in the deck than the letter WParticipants had to press a button every time an M came up in the deckLiberals were shown to make fewer errors in mistaking the W for the M",1
"This behavioral study supported the notion that liberals are better with dealing with conflicting informationConservatives have a stronger sympathetic nervous system response to threatening images and are more likely to interpret ambiguous facial expressions as threateningIn general, conservatives are more likely to report larger social networks, more happiness and better self-esteem than liberalsLiberals are more likely to report greater emotional distress, relationship dissatisfaction and experiential hardship and are more open to experience and tolerate uncertainty and disorder better.Genetic factors account for at least some of the variation of political views",1
"Politics (Greek: Πολιτικά, Politiká) is a work of political philosophy by Aristotle, a 4th-century BC Greek philosopherThe end of the Nicomachean Ethics declared that the inquiry into ethics necessarily follows into politics, and the two works are frequently considered to be parts of a larger treatise—or perhaps connected lectures—dealing with the ""philosophy of human affairs"" The title of Politics literally means ""the things concerning the πόλις : polis"", and is the origin of the modern English word politics",1
"    Overview       Structure   Aristotle's Politics is divided into eight books, which are each further divided into chaptersCitations of this work, as with the rest of the works of Aristotle, are often made by referring to the Bekker section numbersPolitics spans the Bekker sections 1252a to 1342b    Book I   In the first book, Aristotle discusses the city (πόλις : polis) or ""political community"" (κοινωνία πολιτική : koinōnía politikē) as opposed to other types of communities and partnerships such as the household (οἶκος : oikos) and village",1
" The highest form of community is the polisAristotle comes to this conclusion because he believes the public life is far more virtuous than the private and because men are ""political animals""He begins with the relationship between the city and man (I1–2), and then specifically discusses the household (οἶκος : oikos) (I3–13).He takes issue with the view that political rule, kingly rule, rule over slaves and rule over a household or village are only different in size",1
"He then examines in what way the city may be said to be naturalAristotle discusses the parts of the household (οἶκος : oikos), which includes slaves, leading to a discussion of whether slavery can ever be just and better for the person enslaved or is always unjust and badHe distinguishes between those who are slaves because the law says they are and those who are slaves by nature, saying the inquiry hinges on whether there are any such natural slaves",1
" Only someone as different from other people as the body is from the soul or beasts are from human beings would be a slave by nature, Aristotle concludes, all others being slaves solely by law or conventionSome scholars have therefore concluded that the qualifications for natural slavery preclude the existence of such a being.Aristotle then moves to the question of property in general, arguing that the acquisition of property does not form a part of household management (οἰκονομική : oikonomikē) and criticizing those who take it too seriously",1
"It is necessary, but that does not make it a part of household management any more than it makes medicine a part of household management just because health is necessary He criticizes income based upon trade and upon interest, saying that those who become avaricious do so because they forget that money merely symbolizes wealth without being wealth and ""contrary to nature"" on interest because it increases by itself not through exchange",1
"Book I concludes with Aristotle's assertion that the proper object of household rule is the virtuous character of one's wife and children, not the management of slaves or the acquisition of propertyRule over the slaves is despotic, rule over children kingly, and rule over one's wife political (except there is no rotation in office)Aristotle questions whether it is sensible to speak of the ""virtue"" of a slave and whether the ""virtues"" of a wife and children are the same as those of a man before saying that because the city must be concerned that its women and children be virtuous, the virtues that the father should instill are dependent upon the regime and so the discussion must turn to what has been said about the best regime",1
"    Book II   Book II examines various views concerning the best regimeIt opens with an analysis of the regime presented in Plato's Republic (21–5), holding that communal share of property between the guardians will increase rather than decrease dissensions, and sharing of wives and children will destroy natural affection He concludes that common sense is against this arrangement for good reason, and claims that experiment shows it to be impractical Next, an analysis of the regime presented in Plato's Laws (2",1
"6)Aristotle then discusses the systems presented by two other philosophers, Phaleas of Chalcedon (27) and Hippodamus of Miletus (28)After addressing regimes invented by theorists, Aristotle moves to the examination of three regimes that are commonly held to be well managedThese are the Spartan (29), Cretan (210), and Carthaginian (211)The book concludes with some observations on regimes and legislators    Book III   Who can be a citizen?""He who has the power to take part in the deliberative or judicial administration of any state is said by us to be a citizen of that state; and speaking generally, a state is a body of citizens sufficing for the purpose of life",1
"But in practice a citizen is defined to be one of whom both the parents are citizens; others insist on going further back; say two or three or more grandparents."" Aristotle asserts that a citizen is anyone who can take part in the governmental processHe finds that most people in the polis are capable of being citizensThis is contrary to the Platonist view, asserting that only very few can take part in the deliberative or judicial administration of the state",1
"Classification of constitution and common goodJust distribution of political powerTypes of monarchies:Monarchy: exercised over voluntary subjects, but limited to certain functions; the king was a general and a judge, and had control of religionAbsolute: government of one for the absolute good Barbarian: legal and hereditary + willing subjects Dictator: installed by foreign power elective dictatorship + willing subjects (elective tyranny)     Book IV    Tasks of political theory Why are there many types of constitutions? Types of democracies Types of oligarchies Polity (Constitutional Government) – highest form of governmentWhen perverted, a Polity becomes a Democracy, the least harmful derivative government as regarded by Aristotle.Government offices     Book V   Constitutional change Revolutions in different types of constitutions and ways to preserve constitutions Instability of tyrannies     Book VI   Democratic constitutions Oligarchic constitutions     Book VII   What is Eudaimonia, welfare for the individual?  Restate conclusions of Nicomachean Ethics Best life and best state",1
"Ideal state: its population, territory, and position Citizens of the ideal state Marriage and children     Book VIII   Paideia, education in the ideal state Music TheoryFor didactics, Dorian mode is preferred for its manly qualities, over Phrygian mode and Ionian mode     Classification of constitutions   After studying a number of real and theoretical city-states' constitutions, Aristotle classified them according to various criteriaOn one side stand the true (or good) constitutions, which are considered such because they aim for the common good, and on the other side the perverted (or deviant) ones, considered such because they aim for the well being of only a part of the city",1
"The constitutions are then sorted according to the ""number"" of those who participate to the magistracies: one, a few, or manyAristotle's sixfold classification is slightly different from the one found in The Statesman by PlatoThe diagram above illustrates Aristotle's classificationMoreover, following Plato's vague ideas, he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so-called mixed state:   It is … constitutional to take … from oligarchy that offices are to be elected, and from democracy that this is not to be on a property-qualification",1
"This then is the mode of the mixture; and the mark of a good mixture of democracy and oligarchy is when it is possible to speak of the same constitution as a democracy and as an oligarchy To illustrate this approach, Aristotle proposed a first-of-its-kind mathematical model of voting, albeit textually described, where the democratic principle of ""one voter–one vote"" is combined with the oligarchic ""merit-weighted voting""; for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see (Tangian 2020)",1
"    Composition   The literary character of the Politics is subject to some dispute, growing out of the textual difficulties that attended the loss of Aristotle's worksBook III ends with a sentence that is repeated almost verbatim at the start of Book VII, while the intervening Books IV–VI seem to have different flavor from the rest; Book IV seems to refer several times back to the discussion of the best regime contained in Books VII–VIII",1
"Some editors have therefore inserted Books VII–VIII after Book IIIAt the same time, however, references to the ""discourses on politics"" that occur in the Nicomachean Ethics suggest that the treatise as a whole ought to conclude with the discussion of education that occurs in Book VIII of the Politics, although it is not certain that Aristotle is referring to the Politics here.Werner Jaeger suggested that the Politics actually represents the conflation of two, distinct treatises",1
"The first (Books I–III, VII–VIII) would represent a less mature work from when Aristotle had not yet fully broken from Plato, and consequently show a greater emphasis on the best regimeThe second (Books IV–VI) would be more empirically minded, and thus belong to a later stage of developmentCarnes Lord, a scholar on Aristotle, has argued against the sufficiency of this view, however, noting the numerous cross-references between Jaeger's supposedly separate works and questioning the difference in tone that Jaeger saw between them",1
"For example, Book IV explicitly notes the utility of examining actual regimes (Jaeger's ""empirical"" focus) in determining the best regime (Jaeger's ""Platonic"" focus)Instead, Lord suggests that the Politics is indeed a finished treatise, and that Books VII and VIII do belong in between Books III and IV; he attributes their current ordering to a merely mechanical transcription error.It is uncertain whether Politics was translated into Arabic like most of his major works",1

"Politics of India works within the framework of the country's ConstitutionIndia is a parliamentary democratic republic in which the president of India is the head of state and the prime minister of India is the head of governmentIt is based on the federal structure of government, although the word is not used in the Constitution itselfIndia follows the dual polity system, i.efederal in nature, that consists of the central authority at the centre and states at the periphery",1
"The Constitution defines the organisational powers and limitations of both central and state governments; it is well recognised, fluid (Preamble of the Constitution being rigid and to dictate further amendments to the Constitution) and considered supreme, i.ethe laws of the nation must conform to itThere is a provision for a bicameral legislature consisting of an upper house, the Rajya Sabha (Council of States), which represents the states of the Indian federation, and a lower house, the Lok Sabha (House of the People), which represents the people of India as a whole",1
"The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, which is headed by the Supreme CourtThe court's mandate is to protect the Constitution, to settle disputes between the central government and the states, to settle inter-state disputes, to nullify any central or state laws that go against the Constitution and to protect the fundamental rights of citizens, issuing writs for their enforcement in cases of violation.There are 543 members in the Lok Sabha, who are elected using plurality voting (first past the post) system from 543 single-member constituencies",1
"There are 245 members in the Rajya Sabha, out of which 233 are elected through indirect elections by single transferable vote by the members of the state legislative assemblies; 12 other members are elected/nominated by the President of IndiaGovernments are formed through elections held every five years (unless otherwise specified), by parties that secure a majority of members in their respective lower houses (Lok Sabha in the central government and Vidhan Sabha in states)",1
"India had its first general election in 1951, which was won by the Indian National Congress, a political party that went on to dominate subsequent elections until 1977, when a non-Congress government was formed for the first time in independent IndiaThe 1990s saw the end of single-party domination and the rise of coalition governmentsThe elections for the 16th Lok Sabha, held from April 2014 to May 2014, once again brought back single-party rule in the country, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) being able to claim a majority in the Lok Sabha.In recent decades, Indian politics has become a dynastic affair",1
"Possible reasons for this could be the party stability, absence of party organisations, independent civil society associations that mobilise support for the parties and centralised financing of elections    Political parties and alliances    When compared to other democracies, India has had a large number of political parties during its history under democratic governanceIt has been estimated that over 200 parties were formed after India became independent in 1947Leadership of political parties in India is commonly interwoven with well-known families whose dynastic leaders actively play the dominant role in a party",1
"Further, party leadership roles are often transferred to subsequent generations in the same familiesThe two main parties in India are the Bharatiya Janata Party, commonly known as the BJP, which is the leading right-wing nationalist party, and the Indian National Congress, commonly called the INC or Congress, which is the leading centre-left partyThese two parties currently dominate national politics, both adhering their policies loosely to their places on the left–right political spectrum",1
"At present, there are eight national parties and many more state parties    Types of political parties    Every political party in India, whether a national or regional/state party, must have a symbol and must be registered with the Election Commission of IndiaSymbols are used in the Indian political system to identify political parties in part so that illiterate people can vote by recognizing the party symbols.In the current amendment to the Symbols Order, the commission has asserted the following five principles: A party, national or state, must have a legislative presence",1
"A national party's legislative presence must be in the Lok SabhaA state party's legislative presence must be in the State AssemblyA party can set up a candidate only from amongst its own membersA party that loses its recognition shall not lose its symbol immediately but shall be allowed to use that symbol for some time to try and retrieve its statusHowever, the grant of such facility to the party will not mean the extension of other facilities to it, as are available to recognized parties, such as free time on Doordarshan or AIR, free supply of copies of electoral rolls, etc",1
"Recognition should be given to a party only on the basis of its own performance in elections and not because it is a splinter group of some other recognized party.A political party shall be eligible to be recognized as a national party if: it secures at least six percent (6%) of the valid votes polled in any four or more states, at a general election to the Lok Sabha or, to the State Legislative Assembly; and ",1
"in addition, it wins at least four seats in the House of the People from any State or Statesor it wins at least two percent (2%) seats in the House of the People (i.e11 seats in the existing House having 543 members), and these members are elected from at least three different states.Likewise, a political party shall be entitled to be recognized as a state party, if:  it secures at least six percent (6%) of the valid votes polled in the state at a general election, either to the Lok Sabha or to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned; and in addition, it wins at least two seats in the Legislative Assembly of the state concerned",1
"or it wins at least three percent (3%) of the total number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the state, or at least three seats in the Assembly, whichever is more    Party proliferation   Although a strict anti-defection law had been passed in 1984, there has been a continued tendency amongst politicians to float their own parties rather than join a broad based party such as the Congress or the BJPBetween the 1984 and 1989 elections, the number of parties contesting elections increased from 33 to 113",1
"In the decades since, this fragmentation has continued    Alliances   India has a history of party alliances and breakdown of alliancesHowever, there are three party alliances regularly aligning on a national level in competing for Government positionsThe member parties work in harmony for gratifying national interests, although parties can jump ships National Democratic Alliance (NDA) - Right-wing coalition led by BJP was formed in 1998 after the electionsNDA formed a government, although the government didn't last long as AIADMK withdrew support from it resulting in 1999 general elections, in which NDA won and resumed power",1
"The coalition government went on to complete the full five-years term, becoming the first non-Congress government to do soIn the 2014 General Elections, NDA once again returned to powers for the second time, with a historic mandate of 336 out of 543 Lok Sabha seatsBJP itself won 282 seats, thereby electing Narendra Modi as the head of the governmentIn a historic win, the NDA stormed to power for the third term in 2019 with a combined strength of 353 seats, with the BJP itself winning an absolute majority with 303 seats United Progressive Alliance (UPA) - Centre-left coalition led by Indian National Congress; this alliance was created after the 2004 general elections, with the alliance forming the Government",1
"The alliance even after losing some of its members, was re-elected in 2009 General Elections with Manmohan Singh as head of the governmentThe alliance has been in the opposition since the 2014 elections, with the INC being the principal opposition party, but without the official status of the Leader of Opposition since they failed to win the minimum required seats    Corruption   India has seen political corruption for decadesDemocratic institutions soon became federally owned, dissent was eliminated and a majority of citizens paid the price",1
"The political corruption in India is weakening its democracy and has led to the erosion of trust by the general public in the political systemA good amount of money is required in elections which is source of political-capitalist nexus    Candidate selection   Pre-election alliances are common in India with parties deciding to share seatsThis is seen mainly on a state by state basis rather than on the national levelCandidate selection starts after seat sharing has been agreed by alliance fellows.Indian political parties have low level of internal party democracy and therefore, in Indian elections, both at the state or national level, party candidates are typically selected by the party elites, more commonly called the party high command",1
"The party elites use a number of criteria for selecting candidatesThese include the ability of the candidates to finance their own election, their educational attainment, and the level of organization the candidates have in their respective constituenciesQuite often the last criterion is associated with candidate criminality    Local governance    Panchayati Raj Institutions or Local self-government bodies play a crucial role in Indian politics, as it focuses on grassroot-level administration in India",1
"On 24 April 1993, the Constitutional (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 came into force to provide constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj institutionsThis Act was extended to Panchayats in the tribal areas of eight States, namely Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan from 24 December 1996The Act aims to provide a 3-tier system of Panchayati Raj for all States having a population of over 2 million, to hold Panchayat elections regularly every 5 years, to provide reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Women, to appoint State Finance Commission to make recommendations as regards the financial powers of the Panchayats and to constitute District Planning Committee to prepare a draft development plan for the district",1
"    Role of political parties    As with any other democracy, political parties represent different sections among the Indian society and regions, and their core values play a major role in the politics of IndiaBoth the executive branch and the legislative branch of the government are run by the representatives of the political parties who have been elected through the electionsThrough the electoral process, the people of India choose which representative and which political party should run the government",1
"Through elections, any party may gain simple majority in the lower houseCoalitions are formed by the political parties in case no single party gains a simple majority in the lower houseUnless a party or a coalition have a majority in the lower house, a government cannot be formed by that party or the coalition India has a multi-party system, where there are a number of national as well as regional parties",1
"A regional party may gain a majority and rule a particular stateIf a party is represented in more than 4 states, it would be labelled a national party (subject to other criteria above)Out of the 72 years of India's independence, India has been ruled by the Congress party for 53 years as of January 2020The party enjoyed a parliamentary majority save for two brief periods during the 1970s and late 1980s",1
"This rule was interrupted between 1977 and 1980, when the Janata Party coalition won the election owing to public discontent with the controversial state of emergency declared by the then Prime Minister Indira GandhiThe Janata Dal won elections in 1989, but its government managed to hold on to power for only two yearsBetween 1996 and 1998, there was a period of political flux with the government being formed first by the nationalist BJP followed by a left-leaning United Front coalition",1
"In 1998, the BJP formed the National Democratic Alliance with smaller regional parties, and became the first non-INC and coalition government to complete a full five-year termThe 2004 elections saw the INC winning the largest number of seats to form a government leading the United Progressive Alliance, and supported by left-parties and those opposed to the BJPOn 22 May 2004, Manmohan Singh was appointed the prime minister of India following the victory of the INC and the left front in the 2004 Lok Sabha election",1
"The UPA ruled India without the support of the left frontPreviously, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had taken office in October 1999 after a general election in which a BJP-led coalition of 13 parties called the National Democratic Alliance emerged with a majorityIn May 2014, Narendra Modi of BJP was elected as the prime ministerFormation of coalition governments reflects the transition in Indian politics away from the national parties toward smaller, more narrowly based regional parties",1
"Some regional parties, especially in South India, are deeply aligned to the ideologies of the region unlike the national parties and thus the relationship between the central government and the state government in various states has not always been free of rancourDisparity between the ideologies of the political parties ruling the centre and the state leads to severely skewed allocation of resources between the states    Political issues       Social issues   The lack of homogeneity in the Indian population causes division among different sections of the people based on religion, region, language, caste and ethnicity",1
"This has led to the rise of political parties with agendas catering to one or a mix of these groupsParties in India also target people who are not in favour of other parties and use them as an assetSome parties openly profess their focus on a particular groupFor example, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's focus on the Dravidian population and Tamil identity; Biju Janata Dal's championing of Odia culture; the Shiv Sena's pro-Marathi agenda; Naga People's Front's demand for protection of Naga tribal identity; People's Democratic Party; National Conference's calling for Kashmiri Muslim identity and Telugu Desam Party's formation in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh by N",1
"TRama Rao demanding for rights and needs of people of the state onlySome other parties claim to be universal in nature, but tend to draw support from particular sections of the populationFor example, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (translated as National People's Party) has a votebank among the Yadav and Muslim population of Bihar and the All India Trinamool Congress does not have any significant support outside West BengalThe narrow focus and votebank politics of most parties, even in the central government and state legislature, supplements national issues such as economic welfare and national security",1
"Moreover, internal security is also threatened as incidences of political parties instigating and leading violence between two opposing groups of people is a frequent occurrence    Economic problems    Economic issues like poverty, unemployment and development are the main issues that influence politicsGaribi Hatao (eradicate poverty) has been a slogan of the Congress for a long timeBJP encourages a free market economyThe more popular slogan in this field is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (Cooperation with all, progress of all)",1
"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) vehemently supports left-wing politics like land-for-all, right to work and strongly opposes neoliberal policies such as globalisation, capitalism and privatisation    Law and order   Terrorism, Naxalism, religious violence and caste-related violence are important issues that affect the political environment of the Indian nationStringent anti-terror legislation such as TADA, POTA and MCOCA have received much political attention, both in favour and against, and some of these laws were disbanded eventually due to human rights violations",1
"However, UAPA was amended in 2019 to negative effect vis-á-vis human rightsTerrorism has affected politics India since its conception, be it the terrorism supported from Pakistan or the internal guerrilla groups such as NaxalitesIn 1991 the former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated during an election campaignThe suicide bomber was later linked to the Sri Lankan terrorist group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, as it was later revealed the killing was an act of vengeance for Rajiv Gandhi sending troops in Sri Lanka against them in 1987.The Godhra train killings and the Babri Masjid demolition on 6 December 1992 resulted in nationwide communal riots in two months, with worst occurring in Mumbai with at least 900 dead",1
"The riots were followed by 1993 Bombay bombings, which resulted in more deathsLaw and order issues, such as action against organised crime are issues which do not affect the outcomes of electionsOn the other hand, there is a criminal–politician nexusMany elected legislators have criminal cases against themIn July 2008, the Washington Post reported that nearly a fourth of the 540 Indian Parliament members faced criminal charges, ""including human trafficking, child prostitution immigration rackets, embezzlement, rape and even murder""",1
"    High Political Offices in India       President of India    The Constitution of India lays down that the Head of State and Union Executive is the president of IndiaThey are elected for a five-year term by an electoral college consisting of members of both Houses of Parliament and members of legislative assemblies of the statesThe president is eligible for re-elections; however, in India's independent history, only one president has been re-elected – Rajendra Prasad",1
"The president appoints the prime minister of India from the party or coalition which commands maximum support of the Lok Sabha, on whose recommendation he/she nominates the other members of the Union Council of MinistersThe president also appoints judges of the Supreme Court and High CourtsIt is on the president's recommendation that the Houses of Parliament meet, and only the president has the power to dissolve the Lok SabhaFurthermore, no bill passed by Parliament can become law without the president's assent",1
"However, the role of the president of India is largely ceremonialAll the powers of the president mentioned above are exercised on recommendation of the Union Council of Ministers, and the president does not have much discretion in any of these mattersThe president also does not have discretion in the exercise of his executive powers, as the real executive authority lies in the CabinetThe current president is Ram Nath Kovind",1
"    Vice President of India    The office of the vice-president of India is constitutionally the second most senior office in the country, after the presidentThe vice-president is also elected by an electoral college, consisting of members of both houses of ParliamentLike the president, the role of the vice-president is also ceremonial, with no real authority vested in him/herThe vice-president fills in a vacancy in the office of president (till the election of a new president)",1
"The only regular function is that the vice-president functions as the ex officio Chairman of the Rajya SabhaNo other duties/powers are vested in the officeThe current vice-president is Venkaiah Naidu    The Prime Minister and the Union Council of Ministers    The Union Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister, is the body with which the real executive power residesThe prime minister is the recognized head of the governmentThe Union Council of Ministers is the body of ministers with which the prime minister works with on a day-to-day basis",1
"Work is divided between various ministers into various departments and ministriesThe Union Cabinet is a smaller body of senior ministers which lies within the Union Council of Ministers, and is the most powerful set of people in the country, playing an instrumental role in legislation and execution alikeAll members of the Union Council of Ministers must be members of either House of Parliament at the time of appointment or must get elected/nominated to either House within six months of their appointment",1
"It is the Union Cabinet that co-ordinates all foreign and domestic policy of the UnionIt exercises immense control over administration, finance, legislation, military, etcThe Head of the Union Cabinet is the prime ministerThe current prime minister of India is Narendra Modi    State Governments    India has a federal form of government, and hence each state also has its own governmentThe executive of each state is the governor (equivalent to the president of India), whose role is ceremonial",1
"The real power resides with the chief minister (equivalent to the prime minister) and the State Council of MinistersStates may either have a unicameral or bicameral legislature, varying from state to stateThe chief minister and other state ministers are also members of the legislature    Nepotism in Indian Politics    Since the 1980s, Indian politics has become dynastic, possibly due to the absence of a party organization, independent civil society associations that mobilize support for the party, and centralized financing of elections",1
"This phenomenon is seen from national level down to district levelOne example of dynastic politics has been the Nehru–Gandhi family which produced three Indian prime ministersFamily members have also led the Congress party for most of the period since 1978 when Indira Gandhi floated the then Congress(I) faction of the partyThe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party also features several senior leaders who are dynastsDynastic politics is prevalent also in a number of political parties with regional presence such as All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Indian National Congress (INC), Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Jammu & Kashmir National Conference (JKNC),  Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (JKPDP), Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(s)), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), National People's Party (NPP), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), Samajwadi Party (SP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SKD), Shiv Sena (SS), Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP)",1
"Politics of the United States refers to the political entities and processes which comprise government at all levels and all branches, in the United States of America    Federal Government    The United States is a constitutional federal republic, in which the president (the head of state and head of government), Congress, and judiciary share powers reserved to the national government, and the federal government shares sovereignty with the state governmentsThe federal government is divided into three branches, as per the specific terms articulated in the U.S",1
"Constitution:  The executive branch is headed by the president and is independent of the legislatureLegislative power is vested in the two chambers of Congress: the Senate and the House of RepresentativesThe judicial branch (or judiciary), composed of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, exercises judicial powerThe judiciary's function is to interpret the United States Constitution and federal laws and regulationsThis includes resolving disputes between the executive and legislative branches.The federal government's layout is explained in the Constitution",1
"Two political parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, have dominated American politics since the American Civil War, although other parties have existedThere are major differences between the political system of the United States and that of many other developed countriesThese include the increased power of the upper house of the legislature, a wider scope of power held by the Supreme Court, the separation of powers between the legislature and the executive, and the dominance of only two main parties",1
"The United States is one of the world's developed countries where third parties have minimal influence and almost no representation at the national and state levelThe federal entity created by the U.SConstitution is the dominant feature of the American governmental system, as citizens are also subject to a state government and various units of local government (such as counties, municipalities, and special districts)    State government    State governments have the power to make laws on all subjects that are not granted to the federal government nor denied to the states in the U.S",1
"ConstitutionThese include education, family law, contract law, and most crimesUnlike the federal government, which only has those powers granted to it in the Constitution, a state government has inherent powers allowing it to act unless limited by a provision of the state or national constitutionLike the federal government, state governments have three branches: executive, legislative, and judicialThe chief executive of a state is its popularly elected governor, who typically holds office for a four-year term (although in some states the term is two years)",1
"Except for Nebraska, which has unicameral legislature, all states have a bicameral legislature, with the upper house usually called the Senate and the lower house called the House of Representatives, the Assembly or something similarIn most states, senators serve four-year terms, and members of the lower house serve two-year termsThe constitutions of the various states differ in some details but generally follow a pattern similar to that of the federal Constitution, including a statement of the rights of the people and a plan for organizing the government",1
"However, state constitutions are generally more detailedAt the state and local level, the process of initiatives and referendums allow citizens to place new legislation on a popular ballot, or to place legislation that has recently been passed by a legislature on a ballot for a popular voteInitiatives and referendums, along with recall elections and popular primary elections, are signature reforms of the Progressive Era; they are written into several state constitutions, particularly in the Western states",1

"City governments are chartered by states, and their charters detail the objectives and powers of the municipal governmentFor most big cities, cooperation with both state and federal organizations is essential to meeting the needs of their residents Types of city governments vary widely across the nationHowever, almost all have a central council, elected by the voters, and an executive officer, assisted by various department heads, to manage the city's affairs",1
" Cities in the West and South usually have nonpartisan local politicsThere are three general types of city government: the mayor-council, the commission, and the council-managerThese are the pure forms; many cities have developed a combination of two or three of them    Mayor-Council    This is the oldest form of city government in the United States and, until the beginning of the 20th century, was used by nearly all American citiesIts structure is like that of the state and national governments, with an elected mayor as chief of the executive branch and an elected council that represents the various neighborhoods forming the legislative branch",1
"The mayor appoints heads of city departments and other officials (sometimes with the approval of the council), has the power of veto over ordinances (the laws of the city), and often is responsible for preparing the city's budgetThe council passes city ordinances, sets the tax rate on property, and apportions money among the various city departmentsAs cities have grown, council seats have usually come to represent more than a single neighborhood",1
"    Commission   This combines both the legislative and executive functions in one group of officials, usually three or more in number, elected city-wideEach commissioner supervises the work of one or more city departmentsCommissioners also set policies and rules by which the city is operatedOne is named chairperson of the body and is often called the mayor, although their power is equivalent to that of the other commissioners    Council-Manager   The city manager is a response to the increasing complexity of urban problems that need management ability not often possessed by elected public officials",1
"The answer has been to entrust most of the executive powers, including law enforcement and provision of services, to a highly trained and experienced professional city managerThe council-manager plan has been adopted by a large number of citiesUnder this plan, a small, elected council makes the city ordinances and sets policy, but hires a paid administrator, also called a city manager, to carry out its decisionsThe manager draws up the city budget and supervises most of the departments",1
"Usually, there is no set term; the manager serves as long as the council is satisfied with their work    County government   The county is a subdivision of the state, sometimes (but not always) containing two or more townships and several villagesNew York City is so large that it is divided into five separate boroughs, each a county in its own rightOn the other hand, Arlington County, Virginia, the United States' smallest county, located just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., is both an urbanized and suburban area, governed by a unitary county administration",1
"In other cities, both the city and county governments have merged, creating a consolidated city–county governmentIn most U.Scounties, one town or city is designated as the county seat, and this is where the government offices are located and where the board of commissioners or supervisors meetsIn small counties, boards are chosen by the county; in the larger ones, supervisors represent separate districts or townshipsThe board collects taxes for state and local governments; borrows and appropriates money; fixes the salaries of county employees; supervises elections; builds and maintains highways and bridges; and administers national, state, and county welfare programs",1
"In very small counties, the executive and legislative power may lie entirely with a sole commissioner, who is assisted by boards to supervise taxes and electionsIn some New England states, counties do not have any governmental function and are simply a division of land    Town and village government   Thousands of municipal jurisdictions are too small to qualify as city governmentsThese are chartered as towns and villages and deal with local needs such as paving and lighting the streets, ensuring a water supply, providing police and fire protection, and waste management",1
"In many states of the US, the term town does not have any specific meaning; it is simply an informal term applied to populated places (both incorporated and unincorporated municipalities)Moreover, in some states, the term town is equivalent to how civil townships are used in other statesThe government is usually entrusted to an elected board or council, which may be known by a variety of names: town or village council, board of selectmen, board of supervisors, board of commissioners",1
"The board may have a chairperson or president who functions as chief executive officer, or there may be an elected mayorGovernmental employees may include clerk, treasurer, police, fire officers and health and welfare officersOne unique aspect of local government, found mostly in the New England region of the United States, is the town meetingOnce a year, sometimes more often if needed, the registered voters of the town meet in open session to elect officers, debate local issues, and pass laws for operating the government",1
"As a body, they decide on road construction and repair, construction of public buildings and facilities, tax rates, and the town budgetThe town meeting, which has existed for more than three centuries in some places, is often cited as the purest form of direct democracy, in which the governmental power is not delegated, but is exercised directly and regularly by all the people    Suffrage    Suffrage is nearly universal for citizens 18 years of age and older",1
"All states and the District of Columbia contribute to the electoral vote for presidentHowever, the District, and other U.Sholdings like Puerto Rico and Guam, lack representation in CongressThese constituencies do not have the right to choose any political figure outside their respective areasEach commonwealth, territory, or district can only elect a non-voting delegate to serve in the House of RepresentativesVoting rights are sometimes restricted as a result of felony conviction, but such laws vary widely by state",1
"Election of the president is an indirect suffrage: voters vote for electors who compose the United States Electoral College and who, in turn vote for presidentThese presidential electors were originally expected to exercise their own judgementIn modern practice, though, they are expected to vote as pledged and some faithless electors have not    Unincorporated areas   Some states contain unincorporated areas, which are areas of land not governed by any local authorities and rather just by the county, state and federal governments",1
"Residents of unincorporated areas only need to pay taxes to the county, state and federal governments as opposed to the municipal government as wellA notable example of this is Paradise, Nevada, an unincorporated area where many of the casinos commonly associated with Las Vegas are situated    Unincorporated territories    The United States possesses a number of unincorporated territories, including 16 island territories across the globeThese are areas of land which are not under the jurisdiction of any state, and do not have a government established by Congress through an organic act",1
"Citizens of these territories can vote for members of their own local governments, and some can also elect representatives to serve in Congress—though they only have observer statusThe unincorporated territories of the U.Sinclude American Samoa, Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, Navassa Island, Palmyra Atoll, Wake Island, and othersAmerican Samoa is the only territory with a native resident population and is governed by a local authority",1
"Despite the fact that an organic act was not passed in Congress, American Samoa established its own constitution in 1967, and has self governed ever sinceSeeking statehood or independence is often debated in US territories, such as in Puerto Rico, but even if referendums on these issues are held, congressional approval is needed for changes in status to take place.The citizenship status of residents in US unincorporated territories has caused concern for their ability to influence and participate in the politics of the United States",1
"In recent decades, the Supreme Court has established voting as a fundamental right of US citizens, even though residents of territories do not hold full voting rightsDespite this, residents must still abide by federal laws that they cannot equitably influence, as well as register for the national Selective Service System, which has led some scholars to argue that residents of territories are essentially second-class citizensThe legal justifications for these discrepancies stem from the Insular Cases, which were a series of 1901 Supreme Court cases that some consider to be reflective of imperialism and racist views held in the United States",1
"Unequal access to political participation in US territories has also been criticized for affecting US citizens who move to territories, as such an action requires forfeiting the full voting rights that they would have held in the 50 states    Campaign finance    Successful participation, especially in federal elections, requires large amounts of money, especially for television advertisingThis money is very difficult to raise by appeals to a mass base, although in the 2008 election, candidates from both parties had success with raising money from citizens over the Internet., as had Howard Dean with his Internet appeals",1
"Both parties generally depend on wealthy donors and organizations - traditionally the Democrats depended on donations from organized labor while the Republicans relied on business donationsSince 1984, however, the Democrats' business donations have surpassed those from labor organizationsThis dependency on donors is controversial, and has led to laws limiting spending on political campaigns being enacted (see campaign finance reform)Opponents of campaign finance laws cite the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, and challenge campaign finance laws because they attempt to circumvent the people's constitutionally guaranteed rights",1
"Even when laws are upheld, the complication of compliance with the First Amendment requires careful and cautious drafting of legislation, leading to laws that are still fairly limited in scope, especially in comparison to those of other countries such as the United Kingdom, France or Canada    Political culture       Colonial origins    The American political culture is deeply rooted in the colonial experience and the American RevolutionThe colonies were unique within the European world for their vibrant political culture, which attracted ambitious young men into politics",1
"At the time, American suffrage was the most widespread in the world, with every man who owned a certain amount of property allowed to voteDespite the fact that fewer than 1% of British men could vote, most white American men were eligibleWhile the roots of democracy were apparent, deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections, although this declined sharply with the American RevolutionIn each colony a wide range of public and private business was decided by elected bodies, especially the assemblies and county governments",1
"Topics of public concern and debate included land grants, commercial subsidies, and taxation, as well as the oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and schoolsAmericans spent a great deal of time in court, as private lawsuits were very commonLegal affairs were overseen by local judges and juries, with a central role for trained lawyersThis promoted the rapid expansion of the legal profession, and the dominant role of lawyers in politics was apparent by the 1770s, with notable individuals including John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, among many others",1
"The American colonies were unique in world context because of the growth of representation of different interest groupsUnlike Europe, where the royal court, aristocratic families and the established church were in control, the American political culture was open to merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, Scotch Irish, Yankees, Yorkers, and many other identifiable groupsOver 90% of the representatives elected to the legislature lived in their districts, unlike England where it was common to have a member of Parliament and absentee member of Parliament",1
"Finally, and most dramatically, the Americans were fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political values of Republicanism, which stressed equal rights, the need for virtuous citizens, and the evils of corruption, luxury, and aristocracyNone of the colonies had political parties of the sort that formed in the 1790s, but each had shifting factions that vied for power    American ideology    Republicanism, along with a form of classical liberalism remains the dominant ideology",1
"Central documents include the Declaration of Independence (1776), the Constitution (1787), the Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers (1787-1790s), the Bill of Rights (1791), and Lincoln's ""Gettysburg Address"" (1863), among othersAmong the core tenets of this ideology are the following:  Civic duty: citizens have the responsibility to understand and support the government, participate in elections, pay taxes, and perform military serviceOpposition to Political corruptionDemocracy: The government is answerable to citizens, who may change the representatives through elections",1
"Equality before the law: The laws should attach no special privilege to any citizenGovernment officials are subject to the law just as others areFreedom of religion: The government can neither support nor suppress any or all religionFreedom of speech: The government cannot restrict through law or action the personal, non-violent speech of a citizen; a marketplace of ideas.At the time of the United States' founding, the economy was predominantly one of agriculture and small private businesses, and state governments left welfare issues to private or local initiative",1
"As in the UK and other industrialized countries, laissez-faire ideology was largely discredited during the Great DepressionBetween the 1930s and 1970s, fiscal policy was characterized by the Keynesian consensus, a time during which modern American liberalism dominated economic policy virtually unchallengedSince the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, laissez-faire ideology has once more become a powerful force in American politicsWhile the American welfare state expanded more than threefold after WWII, it has been at 20% of GDP since the late 1970s",1
"Today, modern American liberalism, and modern American conservatism are engaged in a continuous political battle, characterized by what the Economist describes as ""greater divisiveness [and] close, but bitterly fought elections.""Before World War II, the United States pursued a noninterventionist policy of in foreign affairs by not taking sides in conflicts between foreign powersThe country abandoned this policy when it became a superpower, and the country mostly supports internationalismResearchers have looked at authoritarian values",1
"The main argument of this paper is that long-run economic changes from globalization have a negative impact on the social identity of historically dominant groupsThis leads to an increase in authoritarian values because of an increased incentive to force minority groups to conform to social norms    Political parties and elections    The United States Constitution has never formally addressed the issue of political parties, primarily because the Founding Fathers did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan",1
"In Federalist Papers No9 and No10, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factionsIn addition, the first president of the United States, George Washington, was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president, and remains to this day the only independent to have held the officeFurthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation",1
" Nevertheless, the beginnings of the American two-party system emerged from his immediate circle of advisers, including Hamilton and MadisonIn partisan elections, candidates are nominated by a political party or seek public office as an independentEach state has significant discretion in deciding how candidates are nominated, and thus eligible to appear on the election ballot Typically, major party candidates are formally chosen in a party primary or convention, whereas minor party and Independents are required to complete a petitioning process",1
"    Political parties    The modern political party system in the United States is a two-party system dominated by the Democratic Party and the Republican PartyThese two parties have won every United States presidential election since 1852 and have controlled the United States Congress since at least 1856From time to time, several other third parties have achieved relatively minor representation at the national and state levelsAmong the two major parties, the Democratic Party generally positions itself as center-left in American politics and supports an American liberalism platform, while the Republican Party generally positions itself as center-right and supports an American conservatism platform",1
"    Elections    As in the United Kingdom and in other similar parliamentary systems, in the U.Seligible Americans vote for a specific candidateWith a federal government, officials are elected at the federal (national), state and local levelsOn a national level, the president is elected indirectly by the people, but instead elected through the Electoral CollegeIn modern times, the electors almost always vote with the popular vote of their state, however in rare occurrences they may vote against the popular vote of their state, becoming what is known as a faithless elector",1
"All members of Congress, and the offices at the state and local levels are directly electedBoth federal and state laws regulate electionsThe United States Constitution defines (to a basic extent) how federal elections are held, in Article One and Article Two and various amendmentsState law regulates most aspects of electoral law, including primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, and the running of state and local elections",1
"     Gerrymandering     Gerrymandering is a process frequently used to adjust the boundaries of electoral districts in order to advantage one political party over the other, representing a confluence of elections and political partiesIn addition to primarily favoring the voters of only one party, gerrymandering has also been criticized for its impact on minority voters in the United StatesMinority voters are often concentrated into single districts which can reduce their potential to otherwise influence elections in other districts—though this process can also help ensure the election of a representative of the same race",1
"However, some racial groups, such as Asian Americans, that do not form a majority in a district's population can miss out on this potential benefitSimilarly, women are rarely concentrated in a way where they compose a significant majority of district's population, meaning that gerrymandering does not provide any counter-benefits to the dilution of the value of their votes.While gerrymandering can cause people to doubt the value of their votes in certain elections, the process has provided some benefits to minorities and marginalized groups",1
"The majority of studies on descriptive representation have suggested that districts where at least 50% of the voter base is composed of minority voters have a higher likelihood of minority representationAdditionally, the minority representatives elected from these districts are frequently reelected, which can increase their ability to gain seniority in a legislature or their party    Organization of American political parties    American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries",1
"The two major parties, in particular, have no formal organization at the national level that controls membershipThus, for an American to say that they are a member of the Democratic or Republican parties is quite different from a Briton's stating that they are a member of the Conservative or Labour partiesIn most U.Sstates, a voter can register as a member of one or another party and/or vote in the primary election for one or another party",1
"A person may choose to attend meetings of one local party committee one day and another party committee the next dayParty identification becomes somewhat formalized when a person runs for partisan officeIn most states, this means declaring oneself a candidate for the nomination of a particular party and intent to enter that party's primary election for an officeA party committee may choose to endorse one or another of those who is seeking the nomination, but in the end the choice is up to those who choose to vote in the primary, and it is often difficult to tell who is going to do the voting",1
"The result is that American political parties have weak central organizations and little central ideology, except by consensusA party really cannot prevent a person who disagrees with the majority of positions of the party or actively works against the party's aims from claiming party membership, so long as the voters who choose to vote in the primary elections elect that personOnce in office, an elected official may change parties simply by declaring such intent",1
"At the federal level, each of the two major parties has a national committee (See, Democratic National Committee, Republican National Committee) that acts as the hub for much fund-raising and campaign activities, particularly in presidential campaignsThe exact composition of these committees is different for each party, but they are made up primarily of representatives from state parties and affiliated organizations, and others important to the partyHowever, the national committees do not have the power to direct the activities of members of the party",1
"Both parties also have separate campaign committees which work to elect candidates at a specific levelThe most significant of these are the Hill committees, which work to elect candidates to each house of CongressState parties exist in all fifty states, though their structures differ according to state law, as well as party rules at both the national and the state levelDespite these weak organizations, elections are still usually portrayed as national races between the political parties",1
"In what is known as ""presidential coattails"", candidates in presidential elections become the de facto leader of their respective party, and thus usually bring out supporters who in turn then vote for his party's candidates for other officesOn the other hand, federal midterm elections (where only Congress and not the president is up for election) are usually regarded as a referendum on the sitting president's performance, with voters either voting in or out the president's party's candidates, which in turn helps the next session of Congress to either pass or block the president's agenda, respectively",1
"    Political pressure groups    Special interest groups advocate the cause of their specific constituencyBusiness organizations will favor low corporate taxes and restrictions of the right to strike, whereas labor unions will support minimum wage legislation and protection for collective bargainingOther private interest groups, such as churches and ethnic groups, are more concerned about broader issues of policy that can affect their organizations or their beliefsOne type of private interest group that has grown in number and influence in recent years is the political action committee or PAC",1
"These are independent groups, organized around a single issue or set of issues, which contribute money to political campaigns for United States Congress or the presidencyPACs are limited in the amounts they can contribute directly to candidates in federal electionsThere are no restrictions, however, on the amounts PACs can spend independently to advocate a point of view or to urge the election of candidates to officePACs today number in the thousands.""The number of interest groups has mushroomed, with more and more of them operating offices in Washington, D.C., and representing themselves directly to Congress and federal agencies,"" says Michael Schudson in his 1998 book The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life",1
"""Many organizations that keep an eye on Washington seek financial and moral support from ordinary citizensSince many of them focus on a narrow set of concerns or even on a single issue, and often a single issue of enormous emotional weight, they compete with the parties for citizens' dollars, time, and passion."" The amount of money spent by these special interests continues to grow, as campaigns become increasingly expensiveMany Americans have the feeling that these wealthy interests, whether corporations, unions or PACs, are so powerful that ordinary citizens can do little to counteract their influences",1
"A survey of members of the American Economic Association find the vast majority regardless of political affiliation to be discontent with the current state of democracy in America The primary concern relates to the prevalence and influence of special interest groups within the political process, which tends to lead to policy consequences that only benefit such special interest groups and politicians Some conjecture that maintenance of the policy status quo and hesitance to stray from it perpetuates a political environment that fails to advance society's welfare",1
"    General developments    Many of America's Founding Fathers hated the thought of political partiesThey were sure quarreling factions would be more interested in contending with each other than in working for the common goodThey wanted citizens to vote for candidates without the interference of organized groups, but this was not to beBy the 1790s, different views of the new country's proper course had already developed, and those who held these opposing views tried to win support for their cause by banding together",1
"The followers of Alexander Hamilton, the Hamiltonian faction, took up the name ""Federalist""; they favored a strong central government that would support the interests of commerce and industryThe followers of Thomas Jefferson, the Jeffersonians and then the ""Anti-Federalists,"" took up the name ""Democratic-Republicans""; they preferred a decentralized agrarian republic in which the federal government had limited powerBy 1828, the Federalists had disappeared as an organization, replaced by the Whigs, brought to life in opposition to the election that year of President Andrew Jackson",1
"Jackson's presidency split the Democratic-Republican Party: Jacksonians became the Democratic Party and those following the leadership of John Quincy Adams became the ""National Republicans."" The two-party system, still in existence today, was born(Note: The National Republicans of John Quincy Adams is not the same party as today's Republican Party.) In the 1850s, the issue of slavery took center stage, with disagreement in particular over the question of whether slavery should be permitted in the country's new territories in the West",1
"The Whig Party straddled the issue and sank to its death after the overwhelming electoral defeat by Franklin Pierce in the 1852 presidential electionEx-Whigs joined the Know Nothings or the newly formed Republican PartyWhile the Know Nothing party was short-lived, Republicans would survive the intense politics leading up to the Civil WarThe primary Republican policy was that slavery be excluded from all the territoriesJust six years later, this new party captured the presidency when Abraham Lincoln won the election of 1860",1
"By then, parties were well established as the country's dominant political organizations, and party allegiance had become an important part of most people's consciousnessParty loyalty was passed from fathers to sons, and party activities, including spectacular campaign events, complete with uniformed marching groups and torchlight parades, were a part of the social life of many communitiesBy the 1920s, however, this boisterous folksiness had diminishedMunicipal reforms, civil service reform, corrupt practices acts, and presidential primaries to replace the power of politicians at national conventions had all helped to clean up politics",1
"    Development of the two-party system in the United States    Since the 1790s, the country has been run by two major parties They try to defeat the other party, but not to destroy it.Occasional minor (or ""third"") political parties appear from time to time; they seldom last more than a decade At various times the Socialist Party, the Farmer-Labor Party and the Populist Party for a few years had considerable local strength, and then faded away",1
"A few merged into the mainstreamFor example, in Minnesota, the Farmer–Labor Party merged into the state's Democratic Party, which is now officially known as the Democratic–Farmer–Labor PartyAt present, the small Libertarian Party has lasted for years and is usually the largest in national elections, but rarely elects anyoneNew York State has a number of additional third parties, who sometimes run their own candidates for office and sometimes nominate the nominees of the two main parties",1
" In the District of Columbia, the D.CStatehood Party has served as a third party with one issue.Almost all public officials in America are elected from single-member districts and win office by beating out their opponents in a system for determining winners called first-past-the-post; the one who gets the plurality wins, (which is not the same thing as actually getting a majority of votes)This encourages the two-party system; see Duverger's law",1
"In the absence of multi-seat congressional districts, proportional representation is impossible and third parties cannot thriveSenators were originally selected by state legislatures, but have been elected by popular vote since 1913Although elections to the Senate elect two senators per constituency (state), staggered terms effectively result in single-seat constituencies for elections to the SenateAnother critical factor has been ballot access lawOriginally, voters went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported",1
"Later on, this developed into a process whereby each political party would create its own ballot and thus the voter would put the party's ballot into the voting boxIn the late nineteenth century, states began to adopt the Australian Secret Ballot Method, and it eventually became the national standardThe secret ballot method ensured that the privacy of voters would be protected (hence government jobs could no longer be awarded to loyal voters) and each state would be responsible for creating one official ballot",1
"The fact that state legislatures were dominated by Democrats and Republicans provided these parties an opportunity to pass discriminatory laws against minor political parties, yet such laws did not start to arise until the first Red Scare that hit America after World War IState legislatures began to enact tough laws that made it harder for minor political parties to run candidates for office by requiring a high number of petition signatures from citizens and decreasing the length of time that such a petition could legally be circulated",1
"Although party members will usually ""toe the line"" and support their party's policies, they are free to vote against their own party and vote with the opposition (""cross the aisle"") when they please""In America the same political labels (Democratic and Republican) cover virtually all public officeholders, and therefore most voters are everywhere mobilized in the name of these two parties,"" says Nelson WPolsby, professor of political science, in the book New Federalist Papers: Essays in Defense of the Constitution",1
"""Yet Democrats and Republicans are not everywhere the sameVariations (sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant) in the 50 political cultures of the states yield considerable differences overall in what it means to be, or to vote, Democratic or RepublicanThese differences suggest that one may be justified in referring to the American two-party system as masking something more like a hundred-party system.""     Political spectrum of the two major parties    During the 20th century, the overall political philosophy of both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party underwent a dramatic shift from their earlier philosophies",1
"From the 1860s to the 1950s, the Republican Party was considered to be the more classically liberal of the two major parties and the Democratic Party the more classically conservative/populist of the two.This changed a great deal with the presidency of Democrat Franklin DRoosevelt, whose New Deal included the founding of Social Security as well as a variety of other federal services and public works projectsRoosevelt's performance in the twin crises of the Depression and World War II led to a sort of polarization in national politics, centered around him; this combined with his increasingly liberal policies to turn FDR's Democrats to the left and the Republican Party further to the right",1
"During the 1950s and the early 1960s, both parties essentially expressed a more centrist approach to politics on the national level and had their liberal, moderate, and conservative wings influential within both partiesFrom the early 1960s, the conservative wing became more dominant in the Republican Party, and the liberal wing became more dominant in the Democratic PartyThe 1964 presidential election heralded the rise of the conservative wing among RepublicansThe liberal and conservative wings within the Democratic Party were competitive until 1972, when George McGovern's candidacy marked the triumph of the liberal wing",1
"This similarly happened in the Republican Party with the candidacy and later landslide election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, which marked the triumph of the conservative wingBy the 1980 election, each major party had largely become identified by its dominant political orientationStrong showings in the 1990s by reformist independent Ross Perot pushed the major parties to put forth more centrist presidential candidates, like Bill Clinton and Bob DolePolarization in Congress was said by some to have been cemented by the Republican takeover of 1994",1
"Others say that this polarization had existed since the late 1980s when the Democrats controlled both houses of CongressLiberals within the Republican Party and conservatives within the Democratic Party and the Democratic Leadership Council neoliberals have typically fulfilled the roles of so-called political mavericks, radical centrists, or brokers of compromise between the two major partiesThey have also helped their respective parties gain in certain regions that might not ordinarily elect a member of that party; the Republican Party has used this approach with centrist Republicans such as Rudy Giuliani, George Pataki, Richard Riordan and Arnold Schwarzenegger",1
"The 2006 elections sent many centrist or conservative Democrats to state and federal legislatures including several, notably in Kansas and Montana, who switched parties    Religious groups   Religious groups and churches often become political pressure groups and parts of political coalitions, despite the Establishment Clause in the US ConstitutionIn recent decades, one of the most notable coalitions has been composed of conservative evangelical Protestants and the broader Republican PartyHowever, some scholars have argued that this coalition may be starting to split, as non-conservative and moderate evangelical Protestants supported then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008",1
"Even if political coalitions between religious groups and political parties split or change, relative to other religions, Christianity has been noted as having a continual dominant impact on politics in the United StatesThis dominance has translated to pressuring policymakers to pass laws influenced by religious views, such as laws related to morality and personal conductA study focusing on this type of political pressure used the alcohol and gambling laws of states as case studies for measuring the impact of religious groups, and it found that large conservative Protestant populations and strong religious pressures had a greater association with more restrictive initial laws than economic development—demonstrating how the presence of religious groups can potentially influence policy",1
"    Concerns about oligarchy   Some views suggest that the political structure of the United States is in many respects an oligarchy, where a small economic elite overwhelmingly dominate policy and lawSome academic researchers suggest a drift toward oligarchy has been occurring by way of the influence of corporations, wealthy, and other special interest groups, leaving individual citizens with less impact than economic elites and organized interest groups in the political process.A study by political scientists Martin Gilens (Princeton University) and Benjamin Page (Northwestern University) released in April 2014, concluded that the U.S",1
"government doesn't represent the interests of the majority of its citizens but instead is ""ruled by those of the rich and powerful""The researchers after analysing nearly 1,800 U.Spolicies between 1981 and 2002, stated that government policies tend to favour special interests and lobbying organizations, and that whenever a majority of citizens disagrees with the economic elites, the elites tend to prevail in getting their wayWhile not characterizing the United States as an ""oligarchy"" or ""plutocracy"" outright, Gilens and Page give weight to the idea of a ""civil oligarchy"" as used by Jeffrey A",1
"Winters, saying, ""Winters has posited a comparative theory of 'Oligarchy,' in which the wealthiest citizens – even in a 'civil oligarchy' like the United States – dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth- and income-protection."" In their study, Gilens and Page reached these conclusions:  When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally loseMoreover, because of the strong status quo bias built into the US political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favor policy change, they generally do not get it",1
"..[T]he preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policyE.JDionne Jrdescribed what he considers the effects of ideological and oligarchical interests on the judiciaryThe journalist, columnist, and scholar interprets recent Supreme Court decisions as ones that allow wealthy elites to use economic power to influence political outcomes in their favorIn speaking about the Supreme Court's McCutcheon v",1
"FEC and Citizens United vFEC decisions, Dionne wrote: ""Thus has this court conferred on wealthy people the right to give vast sums of money to politicians while undercutting the rights of millions of citizens to cast a ballot.""Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman wrote:  The stark reality is that we have a society in which money is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few peopleThis threatens to make us a democracy in name only",1
"    Concerns about political representation   Observations of historical trends and current governmental demographics have raised concerns about the equity of political representation in the United StatesIn particular, scholars have noted that levels of descriptive representation—which refers to when political representatives share demographic backgrounds or characteristics with their constituents—do not match the racial and gender makeup of the USDescriptive representation is noted to be beneficial because of its symbolic representative benefits as a source of emotional identification with one's representatives",1
"Furthermore, descriptive representation can lead to more substantive and functional representation, as well as greater institutional power, which can result in minority constituents having both representatives with matching policy views and power in the political systemServing as a congressional committee chair is considered to be a good example of this relationship, as chairs control which issues are addressed by committees, especially through hearings that bring substantial attention to certain issuesThough minorities like African Americans and Latinos have rarely served as committee chairs, studies have shown that their presence has directly led to significantly higher likelihoods of minority issues being addressed",1
"Given that racial and ethnic minorities of all backgrounds have historically been marginalized from participating in the US political system, their political representation and access to policymaking has been limitedSimilarly, women lack proportional representation in the United States, bringing into question the extent to which women's issues are adequately addressedOther minority groups, such as the LGBTQ community, have also been disadvantaged by an absence of equitable representation—especially since scholars have noted their gradual shift from originally being perceived as more of a moral political issue to being considered an actual constituency.Political representation is also an essential part of making sure that citizens have faith that representatives, political institutions, and democracy take their interests into account",1
"For women and minorities, this issue can occur even in the levels of government that are meant to be closest to constituents, such as among members of Congress in the House of RepresentativesScholars have noted that in positions such as these, even close proximity to constituents does not necessarily translate to an understanding of their needs or experiences and that constituents can still feel unrepresentedIn a democracy, a lack of faith in one's representatives can cause them to search for less-democratic alternative forms of representation, like unelected individuals or interest groups",1
"For racial and ethnic minorities, the risk of seeking alternative representation is especially acute, as lived experiences often lead to different political perspectives that can be difficult for white representatives to fully understand or adequately addressMoreover, studies have begun to increasingly show that people of all races and genders tend to prefer having members of Congress who share their race or gender, which can also lead to more engagement between constituents and their representatives, as well as higher likelihoods of contacting or having faith in their congressperson",1
"In addition to making it more likely that constituents will trust their representatives, having descriptive representation can help sustain an individual's positive perceptions of governmentWhen considering women in particular, it has been suggested that broader economic and social equality could result from first working toward ensuring more equitable political representation for women, which would also help promote increased faith between women and their representatives    Race, ethnicity, and political representation        African Americans    Although African Americans have begun to continually win more elected positions and increase their overall political representation, they still lack proportional representation across a variety of different levels of government",1
"Some estimates indicate that most gains for African Americans—and other minorities in general—have not occurred at higher levels of government, but rather at sub-levels in federal and state governmentsAdditionally, congressional data from 2017 revealed that 35.7% of African Americans nationwide had a congressperson of the same race, while the majority of black Americans were represented by members of Congress of a different raceScholars have partially explained this discrepancy by focusing on the obstacles that black candidates face",1
"Factors like election type, campaign costs, district demographics, and historical barriers, such as voter suppression, can all hinder the likelihood of a black candidate winning an election or even choosing to enter into an election processDemographics, in particular, are noted to have a large influence on black candidate success, as research has shown that the ratio of white-to-black voters can have a significant impact on a black candidate's chance of winning an election and that large black populations tend to increase the resources available to African American candidates",1
"Despite the variety of obstacles that have contributed to the lack of proportional representation for African Americans, other factors have been found to increase the likelihood of a black candidate winning an electionBased on data from a study in Louisiana, prior black incumbency, as well as running for an office that other black candidates had pursued in the past, increased the likelihood of African Americans entering into races and winning elections",1
"     Hispanic and Latino Americans    As the most populous minority demographic identified in the 2010 US Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans have become an increasingly important constituency that is spread throughout the United StatesDespite also constituting 15% of the population in at least a quarter of House districts, Latino representation in Congress has not correspondingly increasedFurthermore, in 2017, Latino members of Congress only represented about one-quarter of the total Latino population in the US",1
"While there are many potential explanations for this disparity, including issues related to voter suppression, surveys of Latino voters have identified trends unique to their demographic—though survey data has still indicated that descriptive representation is important to Hispanic and Latino votersWhile descriptive representation may be considered important, an analysis of a 2004 national survey of Latinos revealed that political participation and substantive representation were strongly associated with each other, possibly indicating that voters mobilize more on behalf of candidates whose policy views reflect their own, rather than for those who share their ethnic background",1
"Moreover, a breakdown of the rationale for emphasizing descriptive representation reveals additional factors behind supporting Latino candidates, such as the view that they may have a greater respect and appreciation for Spanish or a belief that Latinos are ""linked"" together, indicating the significance of shared cultural experiences and valuesAlthough the reasons behind choosing to vote for Latino candidates are not monolithic, the election of Latinos to Congress has been identified as resulting in benefits for minorities overall",1
"While it has been argued that unique district-related issues can take equal or greater precedence than Latino interests for Hispanic and Latino members of Congress, studies have also shown that Latinos are more likely to support African American members of Congress—and vice versa—beyond just what is expected from shared party membership     Native Americans    Similar to other minority groups, Native Americans often lack representation due to electoral policiesGerrymandering, in particular, is noted as a method of concentrating Native voters in a limited number of districts to reduce their ability to influence multiple elections",1
"Despite structural efforts to limit their political representation, some states with large Native American populations have higher levels of representationSouth Dakota has a Native population of about 9% with multiple federally recognized tribal nations, and it has been used as a case study of representationA 2017 study that conducted interviews of former state elected officials in South Dakota revealed that even though many felt that they were only able to implement a limited number of significant changes for tribal communities, they still considered it to be ""absolutely essential"" that Native Americans had at least some descriptive representation to prevent complete exclusion from the political process",1
"Moreover, formerly elected state and local government officials asserted that ensuring that the issues and concerns of tribal nations were addressed and understood depended on politicians with Native backgroundsHistorically-backed suspicion and skepticism of the predominantly white US government was also considered to be an important reason for having representatives that reflect the histories and views of Native Americans     Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders    Relative to other, larger minority demographics in the United States, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) face different challenges related to political representation",1
"Few congressional districts have a population that includes over 50% Asian Americans, which can elevate the likelihood of being represented by someone of a different race or ethnicityAs with other minorities, this can result in people feeling unrepresented by their member of Congress    Gender and political representation    Women have made continual socioeconomic progress in many key areas of society, such as in employment and education, and in comparison to men, women have voted at higher rates for over forty years—making their lack of more proportional representation in the political system surprising",1
"Some scholars have partially attributed this discrepancy to the electoral system in the United States, as it does not provide a mechanism for the types of gender quotas seen in other countriesAdditionally, even though gerrymandering and concentrated political representation can essentially ensure at least some representation for minority racial and ethnic groups, women—who are relatively evenly spread throughout the United States—do not receive similar benefits from this practiceAmong individuals, however, identifying the source of unequal gender representation can be predicted along party and ideological lines",1
"A survey of attitudes toward women candidates revealed that Democrats are more likely to attribute systemic issues to gender inequalities in political representation, while Republicans are less likely to hold this perspectiveWhile identifying an exact source of inequality may ultimately prove unlikely, some recent studies have suggested that the political ambitions of women may be influenced by the wide variety of proposed factors attributed to the underrepresentation of womenIn contrast to attributing specific reasons to unequal representation, political party has also been identified as a way of predicting if a woman running for office is more likely to receive support, as women candidates are more likely to receive votes from members of their party and Independents",1
"     Social inequality and sexism    Social inequality and sexism have been noted by scholars as influencing the electoral process for womenIn a survey of attitudes toward women candidates, women respondents were far more likely to view the process of running for office as ""hostile"" to women than men, especially when considering public hesitancy to support women candidates, media coverage, and public discriminationPolitical fundraising for candidates is also an area of inequality, as men donate at a higher rate than women—which is compounded by gender and racial inequalities related to income and employment",1
"However, recent increases in women-focused fundraising groups have started to alter this imbalanceGiven that disproportionate levels of household labor often become the responsibility of women, discrimination within households has also been identified as a major influence on the capability of women to run for officeFor women in the LGBTQ community, some scholars have raised concern about the unequal attention paid to the needs of lesbians compared to transgender, bisexual, and queer women, with lesbian civil rights described as receiving more of a focus from politicians",1
"     Social pressures and influences    Social pressures are another influence on women who run for office, often coinciding with sexism and discriminationSome scholars have argued that views of discrimination have prompted a decrease in the supply of women willing to run for office, though this has been partially countered by those who argue that women are actually just more ""strategic"" when trying to identify an election with favorable conditionsOther factors, like the overrepresentation of men, have been described as influencing perceptions of men as somehow inherently more effective as politicians or leaders, which some scholars argue could pressure women to stay out of elections",1
"However, others contend that the overrepresentation of men can actually result in ""political momentum"" for women, such as during the Year of the WomanWithin some racial and ethnic groups, social influences can also shape political engagementAmong Latinos, Latinas are more likely to partake in non-electoral activities, like community organizing, when compared to menDespite differences in political activity and social pressures, elected women from both political parties have voiced their support for electing more women to Congress to increase the acceptance of their voices and experiences",1
"Furthermore, studies have found that increasing the descriptive representation of women can provide positive social influences for democracy as a whole, such as improved perceptions of an individual's political efficacy and government's responsiveness to the needs of peopleWhen women can vote for a woman candidate of the same party, studies have also found that these influences can be magnified    LGBT political representation    Although some scholars have disputed the benefits of descriptive representation, only a small number have argued that this form of representation actually has negative impacts on the group it represents",1
"Studies of bills relating to LGBT rights in state legislatures have provided a more nuanced analysisPro-LGBT bills tend to be introduced in higher numbers when more LGBT representatives are elected to state legislatures, which may also indicate an increased likelihood of substantive representationIncreases in openly LGBT state lawmakers have also been hypothesized to inadvertently result in more anti-LGBT legislation, potentially as the result of backlash to their presenceDespite the risk of negative consequences, at least one study has concluded that the LGBT community receives net-benefits from increased openly LGBT representation",1
"On the federal level, the presence of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus has been identified as improving the ability of Congress to address the intersectional issues faced by the LGBT community, as well as provide a source of pressure other than constituency on members of Congress to address LGBT issuesAdditionally, non-LGBT members of the caucus have been criticized for not sponsoring enough legislation, emphasizing the value of openly LGBT members of Congress",1
"While descriptive representation has provided benefits overall, scholars have noted that some groups in the community, such as transgender and bisexual people, tend to receive less focus than gays and lesbians    Reform       See also   Foreign relations of the United States Gun politics in the United States Political ideologies in the United States Politics of the Southern United States Initiatives and referendums in the United States     References       Further reading   Barone, Michael et al",1

"Politics (from Greek: Πολιτικά, politiká, 'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or statusThe branch of social science that studies politics and government is referred to as political scienceIt may be used positively in the context of a ""political solution"" which is compromising and nonviolent, or descriptively as ""the art or science of government"", but also often carries a negative connotation",1
"For example, abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared that ""we do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us."" The concept has been defined in various ways, and different approaches have fundamentally differing views on whether it should be used extensively or limitedly, empirically or normatively, and on whether conflict or co-operation is more essential to itA variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries",1
"Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international levelIn modern nation states, people often form political parties to represent their ideasMembers of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders",1
"An election is usually a competition between different partiesA political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a societyThe history of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics in the West, and Confucius's political manuscripts and Chanakya's Arthashastra in the East    Etymology   The English politics has its roots in the name of Aristotle's classic work, Politiká, which introduced the Greek term politiká (Πολιτικά, 'affairs of the cities')",1
"In the mid-15th century, Aristotle's composition would be rendered in Early Modern English as Polettiques [sic], which would become Politics in Modern EnglishThe singular politic first attested in English in 1430, coming from Middle French politique—itself taking from politicus, a Latinization of the Greek πολιτικός (politikos) from πολίτης (polites, 'citizen') and πόλις (polis, 'city')    Definitions   In the view of Harold Lasswell, politics is ""who gets what, when, how."" For David Easton, it is about ""the authoritative allocation of values for a society."" To Vladimir Lenin, ""politics is the most concentrated expression of economics."" Bernard Crick argued that ""politics is a distinctive form of rule whereby people act together through institutionalized procedures to resolve differences, to conciliate diverse interests and values and to make public policies in the pursuit of common purposes."" According to Adrian Leftwich ""Politics comprises all the activities of co-operation, negotiation and conflict within and between societies, whereby people go about organizing the use, production or distribution of human, natural and other resources in the course of the production and reproduction of their biological and social life."" Politics is the sphere of activity involved in running a state",1
"According to Max Webber the ""state can be defined as a human community that successfully claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory""In the view of Manjunath Hegde, politics is "" the power, to rule the people.""     Approaches   There are several ways in which approaching politics has been conceptualized    Extensive and limited   Adrian Leftwich has differentiated views of politics based on how extensive or limited their perception of what accounts as 'political' is",1
"The extensive view sees politics as present across the sphere of human social relations, while the limited view restricts it to certain contextsFor example, in a more restrictive way, politics may be viewed as primarily about governance, while a feminist perspective could argue that sites which have been viewed traditionally as non-political, should indeed be viewed as political as wellThis latter position is encapsulated in the slogan the personal is political, which disputes the distinction between private and public issues",1
"Instead, politics may be defined by the use of power, as has been argued by Robert ADahl    Moralism and realism   Some perspectives on politics view it empirically as an exercise of power, while others see it as a social function with a normative basisThis distinction has been called the difference between political moralism and political realismFor moralists, politics is closely linked to ethics, and is at its extreme in utopian thinking",1
"For example, according to Hannah Arendt, the view of Aristotle was that ""to be political…meant that everything was decided through words and persuasion and not through violence;"" while according to Bernard Crick ""[p]olitics is the way in which free societies are governedPolitics is politics and other forms of rule are something else."" In contrast, for realists, represented by those such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, and Harold Lasswell, politics is based on the use of power, irrespective of the ends being pursued",1
"    Conflict and co-operation   Agonism argues that politics essentially comes down to conflict between conflicting interestsPolitical scientist Elmer Schattschneider argued that ""at the root of all politics is the universal language of conflict,"" while for Carl Schmitt the essence of politics is the distinction of 'friend' from foe'This is in direct contrast to the more co-operative views of politics by Aristotle and CrickHowever, a more mixed view between these extremes is provided by Irish political scientist Michael Laver, who noted that:Politics is about the characteristic blend of conflict and co-operation that can be found so often in human interactions",1
"Pure conflict is warPure co-operation is true lovePolitics is a mixture of both    History    The history of politics spans human history and is not limited to modern institutions of government    Prehistoric   Frans de Waal argued that already chimpanzees engage in politics through ""social manipulation to secure and maintain influential positions."" Early human forms of social organization—bands and tribes—lacked centralized political structuresThese are sometimes referred to as stateless societies    Early states   In ancient history, civilizations did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as frontiers",1
"Early dynastic Sumer, and early dynastic Egypt were the first civilizations to define their bordersMoreover, up to the 12th century, many people lived in non-state societiesThese range from relatively egalitarian bands and tribes to complex and highly stratified chiefdoms     State formation     There are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not othersOther scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.Voluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest",1
"The theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formationOne of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the hydraulic hypothesis, which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects.Conflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states",1
"In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over othersSome theories in turn argue that warfare was critical for state formation     Ancient history    The first states of sorts were those of early dynastic Sumer and early dynastic Egypt, which arose from the Uruk period and Predynastic Egypt respectively around approximately 3000 BCE",1
"Early dynastic Egypt was based around the Nile River in the north-east of Africa, the kingdom's boundaries being based around the Nile and stretching to areas where oases existedEarly dynastic Sumer was located in southern Mesopotamia with its borders extending from the Persian Gulf to parts of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.Although state-forms existed before the rise of the Ancient Greek empire, the Greeks were the first people known to have explicitly formulated a political philosophy of the state, and to have rationally analyzed political institutions",1
"Prior to this, states were described and justified in terms of religious myths.Several important political innovations of classical antiquity came from the Greek city-states (polis) and the Roman RepublicThe Greek city-states before the 4th century granted citizenship rights to their free population; in Athens these rights were combined with a directly democratic form of government that was to have a long afterlife in political thought and history    Modern states    The Peace of Westphalia (1648) is considered by political scientists to be the beginning of the modern international system, in which external powers should avoid interfering in another country's domestic affairs",1
"The principle of non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs was laid out in the mid-18th century by Swiss jurist Emer de VattelStates became the primary institutional agents in an interstate system of relationsThe Peace of Westphalia is said to have ended attempts to impose supranational authority on European statesThe ""Westphalian"" doctrine of states as independent agents was bolstered by the rise in 19th century thought of nationalism, under which legitimate states were assumed to correspond to nations—groups of people united by language and culture.In Europe, during the 18th century, the classic non-national states were the multinational empires: the Austrian Empire, Kingdom of France, Kingdom of Hungary, the Russian Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire",1
"Such empires also existed in Asia, Africa, and the Americas; in the Muslim world, immediately after the death of Muhammad in 632, Caliphates were established, which developed into multi-ethnic trans-national empiresThe multinational empire was an absolute monarchy ruled by a king, emperor or sultanThe population belonged to many ethnic groups, and they spoke many languagesThe empire was dominated by one ethnic group, and their language was usually the language of public administration",1
"The ruling dynasty was usually, but not always, from that groupSome of the smaller European states were not so ethnically diverse, but were also dynastic states, ruled by a royal houseA few of the smaller states survived, such as the independent principalities of Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, and the republic of San MarinoMost theories see the nation state as a 19th-century European phenomenon, facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education, mass literacy, and mass media",1
"However, historians also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in Portugal and the Dutch RepublicScholars such as Steven Weber, David Woodward, Michel Foucault, and Jeremy Black have advanced the hypothesis that the nation state did not arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source, nor was it an accident of history or political inventionRather, the nation state is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in political economy, capitalism, mercantilism, political geography, and geography combined with cartography and advances in map-making technologies.Some nation states, such as Germany and Italy, came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by nationalists, during the 19th century",1
"In both cases, the territory was previously divided among other states, some of them very smallLiberal ideas of free trade played a role in German unification, which was preceded by a customs union, the ZollvereinNational self-determination was a key aspect of United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, leading to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, while the Russian Empire became the Soviet Union after the Russian Civil War",1
"Decolonization lead to the creation of new nation states in place of multinational empires in the Third World    Globalization    Political globalization began in the 20th century through intergovernmental organizations and supranational unionsThe League of Nations was founded after World War I, and after World War II it was replaced by the United NationsVarious international treaties have been signed through itRegional integration has been pursued by the African Union, ASEAN, the European Union, and Mercosur",1
"International political institutions on the international level include the International Criminal Court, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization    Political science    The study of politics is called political science, or politologyIt comprises numerous subfields, including comparative politics, political economy, international relations, political philosophy, public administration, public policy, gender and politics, and political methodologyFurthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of economics, law, sociology, history, philosophy, geography, psychology/psychiatry, anthropology, and neurosciences",1
"Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of constitutions, political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspectiveInternational relations deals with the interaction between nation-states as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizationsPolitical philosophy is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophersPolitical science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in psychology, social research, and cognitive neuroscience",1
"Approaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational choice theory, behavioralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism, institutionalism, and pluralismPolitical science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, survey research, statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research, and model building    Political system    The political system defines the process for making official government decisions",1
"It is usually compared to the legal system, economic system, cultural system, and other social systemsAccording to David Easton, ""A political system can be designated as the interactions through which values are authoritatively allocated for a society."" Each political system is embedded in a society with its own political culture, and they in turn shape their societies through public policyThe interactions between different political systems are the basis for global politics",1
"    Forms of government    Forms of government can be classified by several waysIn terms of the structure of power, there are monarchies (including constitutional monarchies) and republics (usually presidential, semi-presidential, or parliamentary)The separation of powers describes the degree of horizontal integration between the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and other independent institutions     Source of power    The source of power determines the difference between democracies, oligarchies, and autocraciesIn a democracy, political legitimacy is based on popular sovereignty",1
"Forms of democracy include representative democracy, direct democracy, and demarchyThese are separated by the way decisions are made, whether by elected representatives, referendums, or by citizen juriesDemocracies can be either republics or constitutional monarchiesOligarchy is a power structure where a minority rulesThese may be in the form of anocracy, aristocracy, ergatocracy, geniocracy, gerontocracy, kakistocracy, kleptocracy, meritocracy, noocracy, particracy, plutocracy, stratocracy, technocracy, theocracy, or timocracy Autocracies are either dictatorships (including military dictatorships) or absolute monarchies",1
"     Vertical integration    In terms of level of vertical integration, political systems can be divided into (from least to most integrated) confederations, federations, and unitary statesA federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a central federal government (federalism)In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body",1
"Federations were formed first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, AustraliaCompared to a federation, a confederation has less centralized power    State    All the above forms of government are variations of the same basic polity, the sovereign stateThe state has been defined by Max Weber as a political entity that has monopoly on violence within its territory, while the Montevideo Convention holds that states need to have a defined territory; a permanent population; a government; and a capacity to enter into international relations",1
"A stateless society is a society that is not governed by a stateIn stateless societies, there is little concentration of authority; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in power and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be smallStateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.While stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a sovereign state",1
"In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield little or no actual powerOver the course of history most stateless peoples have been integrated into the state-based societies around them.Some political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achievedA central tenet of anarchism is the advocacy of society without statesThe type of society sought for varies significantly between anarchist schools of thought, ranging from extreme individualism to complete collectivism",1
"In Marxism, Marx's theory of the state considers that in a post-capitalist society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and wither awayA related concept is that of stateless communism, a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx's anticipated post-capitalist society    Constitutions   Constitutions are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of governmentAlthough a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution",1
The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative and judiciary branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriateEngland did set the fashion of written constitutions during the Civil War but after the Restoration abandoned them to be taken up later by the American Colonies after their emancipation and then France after the Revolution and the rest of Europe including the European colonies,1
"Constitutions often set out separation of powers, dividing the government into the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary (together referred to as the trias politica), in order to achieve checks and balances within the stateAdditional independent branches may also be created, including civil service commissions, election commissions, and supreme audit institutions    Political culture    Political culture describes how culture impacts politicsEvery political system is embedded in a particular political cultureLucian Pye's definition is that ""Political culture is the set of attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments, which give order and meaning to a political process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the political system"".Trust is a major factor in political culture, as its level determines the capacity of the state to function",1
"Postmaterialism is the degree to which a political culture is concerned with issues which are not of immediate physical or material concern, such as human rights and environmentalismReligion has also an impact on political culture    Political dysfunction        Political corruption     Political corruption is the use of powers for illegitimate private gain, conducted by government officials or their network contactsForms of political corruption include bribery, cronyism, nepotism, and political patronageForms of political patronage, in turn, includes clientelism, earmarking, pork barreling, slush funds, and spoils systems; as well as political machines, which is a political system that operates for corrupt ends",1
"When corruption is embedded in political culture, this may be referred to as patrimonialism or neopatrimonialismA form of government that is built on corruption is called a kleptocracy ('rule of thieves')    Levels of politics       Macropolitics    Macropolitics can either describe political issues that affect an entire political system (e.gthe nation state), or refer to interactions between political systems (e.ginternational relations).Global politics (or world politics) covers all aspects of politics that affect multiple political systems, in practice meaning any political phenomenon crossing national borders",1
"This can include cities, nation-states, multinational corporations, non-governmental organizations, and/or international organizationsAn important element is international relations: the relations between nation-states may be peaceful when they are conducted through diplomacy, or they may be violent, which is described as warStates that are able to exert strong international influence are referred to as superpowers, whereas less-powerful ones may be called regional or middle powersThe international system of power is called the world order, which is affected by the balance of power that defines the degree of polarity in the system",1
"Emerging powers are potentially destabilizing to it, especially if they display revanchism or irredentismPolitics inside the limits of political systems, which in contemporary context correspond to national borders, are referred to as domestic politicsThis includes most forms of public policy, such as social policy, economic policy, or law enforcement, which are executed by the state bureaucracy    Mesopolitics   Mesopolitics describes the politics of intermediary structures within a political system, such as national political parties or movements.A political party is a political organization that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within government, usually by participating in political campaigns, educational outreach, or protest actions",1
"Parties often espouse an expressed ideology or vision, bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests.Political parties within a particular political system together form the party system, which can be either multiparty, two-party, dominant-party, or one-party, depending on the level of pluralismThis is affected by characteristics of the political system, including its electoral systemAccording to Duverger's law, first-past-the-post systems are likely to lead to two-party systems, while proportional representation systems are more likely to create a multiparty system",1
"    Micropolitics   Micropolitics describes the actions of individual actors within the political systemThis is often described as political participationPolitical participation may take many forms, including:  Activism Boycott Civil disobedience Demonstration Petition Picketing Strike action Tax resistance Voting (or its opposite, abstentionism)     Political values       Democracy    Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomesThe uncertainty of outcomes is inherent in democracy",1
"Democracy makes all forces struggle repeatedly to realize their interests and devolves power from groups of people to sets of rules.Among modern political theorists, there are three contending conceptions of democracy: aggregative, deliberative, and radical     Aggregative    The theory of aggregative democracy claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit the preferences of citizens, and aggregate them together to determine what social policies the society should adoptTherefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on voting, where the policy with the most votes gets implemented",1
"Different variants of aggregative democracy existUnder minimalism, democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic electionsAccording to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not ""rule"" because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-foundedJoseph Schumpeter articulated this view most famously in his book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy",1
"Contemporary proponents of minimalism include William HRiker, Adam Przeworski, Richard PosnerAccording to the theory of direct democracy, on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposalsProponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this viewPolitical activity can be valuable in itself, it socializes and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elitesMost importantly, citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies",1
Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter—with half to their left and the other half to their rightThis is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votesAnthony Downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governmentsDowns laid out this view in his 1957 book An Economic Theory of Democracy.Robert A,1
"Dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision)He uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy",1
"First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the societyHowever, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participationSimilarly, Ronald Dworkin argues that ""democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.""      Deliberative     Deliberative democracy is based on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation",1
"Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in votingAuthentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groupsIf the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule",1
"     Radical     Radical democracy is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in societyDemocracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision-making processes    Equality    Equality is a state of affairs in which all people within a specific society or isolated group have the same social status, especially socioeconomic status, including protection of human rights and dignity, and equal access to certain social goods and social services",1
"Furthermore, it may also include health equality, economic equality and other social securitiesSocial equality requires the absence of legally enforced social class or caste boundaries and the absence of discrimination motivated by an inalienable part of a person's identityTo this end there must be equal justice under law, and equal opportunity regardless of, for example, sex, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, origin, caste or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health or disability",1
"     Left–right spectrum    A common way of understanding politics is through the left–right political spectrum, which ranges from left-wing politics via centrism to right-wing politicsThis classification is comparatively recent and dates from the French Revolution, when those members of the National Assembly who supported the republic, the common people and a secular society sat on the left and supporters of the monarchy, aristocratic privilege and the Church sat on the right.Today, the left is generally progressivist, seeking social progress in society",1
"The more extreme elements of the left, named the far-left, tend to support revolutionary means for achieving thisThis includes ideologies such as Communism and MarxismThe center-left, on the other hand, advocate for more reformist approaches, for example that of social democracyIn contrast, the right is generally motivated by conservatism, which seeks to conserve what it sees as the important elements of societyThe far-right goes beyond this, and often represents a reactionary turn against progress, seeking to undo it",1
"Examples of such ideologies have included Fascism and NazismThe center-right may be less clear-cut and more mixed in this regard, with neoconservatives supporting the spread of free markets and capitalism, and one-nation conservatives more open to social welfare programsAccording to Norberto Bobbio, one of the major exponents of this distinction, the left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality—believing it to be unethical or unnatural, while the right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian",1
"Some ideologies, notably Christian Democracy, claim to combine left and right-wing politics; according to Geoffrey KRoberts and Patricia Hogwood, ""In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."" Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include Fascist Terza Posizione economic politics in Italy and Peronism in Argentina    Freedom    Political freedom (also known as political liberty or autonomy) is a central concept in political thought and one of the most important features of democratic societies",1
"Negative liberty has been described as freedom from oppression or coercion and unreasonable external constraints on action, often enacted through civil and political rights, while positive liberty is the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions, e.geconomic compulsion, in a societyThis capability approach to freedom requires economic, social and cultural rights in order to be realized     Authoritarianism and libertarianism    Authoritarianism and libertarianism disagree the amount of individual freedom each person possesses in that society relative to the state",1
"One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where ""individual rights and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities,"" while libertarians generally oppose the state and hold the individual as sovereignIn their purest form, libertarians are anarchists, who argue for the total abolition of the state, of political parties and of other political entities, while the purest authoritarians are, by definition, totalitarians who support state control over all aspects of society.For instance, classical liberalism (also known as laissez-faire liberalism) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and limited government",1
"This includes the importance of human rationality, individual property rights, free markets, natural rights, the protection of civil liberties, constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of John Locke, Adam Smith, David Hume, David Ricardo, Voltaire, Montesquieu and othersAccording to the libertarian Institute for Humane Studies, ""the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'"" For anarchist political philosopher L",1

"Right-wing politics is generally defined by support of the view that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable, typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics, or tradition.: 693, 721  Hierarchy and inequality may be seen as natural results of traditional social differences or competition in market economiesRight-wing politics are considered the counterpart to left-wing politics, and the left–right political spectrum is one of the most widely accepted political spectrums.The term right-wing can generally refer to the section of a political party or system that advocates free enterprise and private ownership, and typically favours socially traditional ideas.The Right includes social conservatives and fiscal conservatives, while a minority of right-wing movements, such as fascists, harbor anti-capitalist sentiments",1
"The Right also includes certain groups who are culturally liberal but fiscally conservative, such as right-wing libertarians    Positions   The following positions are typically associated with right-wing politics    Anti-communism    The original use of the term ""right-wing"", relative to communism, placed the conservatives on the right, the liberals in the centre and the communists on the leftBoth the conservatives and the liberals were strongly anti-communistThe history of the use of the term right-wing in reference to anti-communism is a complicated one.Early Marxist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the European continent at the time",1
"Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views and the Communist Manifesto, which began ""[a] spectre [that] is haunting Europe"", and stated that monarchs feared for their thronesAdvocacy of communism was illegal in the Russian Empire, the German Empire, and Austria-Hungary, the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to World War IMany monarchists (except constitutional monarchists) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order",1
"The struggle between monarchists and communists was often described as a struggle between the Right and the LeftBy World War I, in most European monarchies the divine right of kings had become discredited and was replaced by liberal and nationalist movementsMost European monarchs became figureheads or they yielded some power to elected governmentsThe most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist Soviet UnionThe Russian Revolution inspired a series of other communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917–1923",1
"Many of these, such as the German Revolution, were defeated by nationalist and monarchist military unitsDuring this period, nationalism began to be considered right-wing, especially when it opposed the internationalism of the communistsThe 1920s and 1930s saw the decline of traditional right-wing politicsThe mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising fascist movements on the one hand and by American-inspired liberal conservatives on the otherWhen communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, their opponents were usually colonial authorities and the term right-wing came to be applied to colonialism",1
"After World War II, communism became a global phenomenon and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the United States and its NATO alliesConservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religious values, and nationalismThroughout the Cold War, colonial governments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America turned to the United States for political and economic supportCommunists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying Wall Street as the oppressor of the masses",1
"The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy, and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at homeThis led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term McCarthyismWhile both liberals and conservatives were anti-communist, the followers of Senator McCarthy were called right-wing and those on the right called liberals who favored free speech, even for communists, leftist",1
"    Economics   In France after the French Revolution, the Right fought against the rising power of those who had grown rich through commerce, and sought to preserve the rights of the hereditary nobilityThey were uncomfortable with capitalism, the Enlightenment, individualism, and industrialism, and fought to retain traditional social hierarchies and institutionsIn Europe's history, there have been strong collectivist right-wing movements, such as in the social Catholic right, that have exhibited hostility to all forms of liberalism (including economic liberalism) and have historically advocated for paternalist class harmony involving an organic-hierarchical society where workers are protected while class hierarchy remains",1
" In the nineteenth century, the Right had shifted to support the newly rich in some European countries (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working classOther right-wing movements—such as Carlism in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany, and Russia—remained hostile to capitalism and industrialismNevertheless, a few right-wing movements—notably the French Nouvelle Droite, CasaPound, and American paleoconservatism—are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society",1
"These forces see capitalism and industrialism as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that are essential for social order.In modern times, ""right-wing"" is sometimes used to describe laissez-faire capitalismIn Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflicts with workers after 1848In France, the Right's support of capitalism can be traced to the late nineteenth centuryThe so-called neoliberal Right, popularised by US President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, combines support for free markets, privatisation, and deregulation with traditional right-wing support for social conformity",1
"Right-wing libertarianism (sometimes known as libertarian conservatism or conservative libertarianism) supports a decentralised economy based on economic freedom and holds property rights, free markets, and free trade to be the most important kinds of freedomPolitical theorist Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked.Conservative authoritarians and those on the far-right have supported fascism and corporatism, a political ideology which advocates the organization of society by corporate groups—such as agricultural, labour, military, scientific, or guild associations—on the basis of their common interests",1
"    Nationalism    In France, nationalism was originally a left-wing and Republican ideologyAfter the period of boulangisme and the Dreyfus Affair, nationalism became a trait of the right-wingRight-wing nationalists sought to define and defend a ""true"" national identity from elements which they believed were corrupting that identitySome were supremacists, who in accordance with scientific racism and social Darwinism applied the concept of ""survival of the fittest"" to nations and racesRight-wing nationalism was influenced by Romantic nationalism, in which the state derives its political legitimacy from the organic unity of those who it governs",1
"This generally includes the language, race, culture, religion, and customs of the nation, all of which were ""born"" within its cultureLinked with right-wing nationalism is cultural conservatism, which supports the preservation of the heritage of a nation or culture and often sees deviations from cultural norms as an existential threat    Natural law and traditionalism    Right-wing politics typically justifies a hierarchical society on the basis of natural law or tradition.Traditionalism was advocated by a group of United States university professors (labeled the ""New Conservatives"" by the popular press) who rejected the concepts of individualism, liberalism, modernity, and social progress, seeking instead to promote what they identified as cultural and educational renewal and a revived interest in what T",1

" Daniel Stockemer states, the radical right is, ""Targeting immigrants as a threat to employment, security and cultural cohesion.""In the United States, the Tea Party movement stated that the core beliefs for membership were the primacy of individual liberties as defined by the Constitution of the United States, preference for a small federal government, and respect for the rule of lawSome policy positions included opposition to illegal immigration and support for a strong national military force, the right to individual gun ownership, cutting taxes, reducing government spending, and balancing the budget",1
"    Religion    Philosopher and diplomat Joseph de Maistre argued for the indirect authority of the Pope over temporal mattersAccording to Maistre, only governments which were founded upon Christian constitutions—which were implicit in the customs and institutions of all European societies, especially the Catholic European monarchies—could avoid the disorder and bloodshed that followed the implementation of rationalist political programs, such as the chaos which occurred during the French RevolutionSome prelates of the Church of England–established by Henry VIII and headed by the current sovereign—are given seats in the House of Lords (as Lords Spiritual); but they are considered politically neutral rather than specifically right- or left-wing",1
"American right-wing media outlets oppose sex outside marriage and same-sex marriage, and they sometimes reject scientific positions on evolution and other matters where science tends to disagree with the Bible.The term family values has been used by right-wing parties—such as the Republican Party in the United States, the Family First Party in Australia, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, and the Bharatiya Janata Party in India—to signify support for traditional families and opposition to the changes the modern world has made in how families live",1
"Supporters of ""family values"" may oppose abortion, euthanasia, and teenage pregnancy.Outside the West, the Hindu nationalist movement has attracted privileged groups which fear encroachment on their dominant positions, as well as ""plebeian"" and impoverished groups which seek recognition around a majoritarian rhetoric of cultural pride, order, and national strength.In Israel, Meir Kahane advocated that Israel should be a theocratic state, where non-Jews have no voting rights, and the far-right Lehava strictly opposes Jewish assimilation and the Christian presence in Israel",1
"The Jewish Defence League (JDL) in the United States was classified as ""a right wing terrorist group"" by the FBI in 2001.Many Islamist groups have been called right-wing, including the Great Union Party, the Combatant Clergy Association/Association of Militant Clergy, and the Islamic Society of Engineers of Iran    Social stratification    Right-wing politics involves, in varying degrees, the rejection of some egalitarian objectives of left-wing politics, claiming either that social or economic inequality is natural and inevitable or that it is beneficial to society",1
"Right-wing ideologies and movements support social orderThe original French right-wing was called ""the party of order"" and held that France needed a strong political leader to keep order.Conservative British scholar RJWhite, who rejects egalitarianism, wrote: ""Men are equal before God and the laws, but unequal in all else; hierarchy is the order of nature, and privilege is the reward of honourable service""American conservative Russell Kirk also rejected egalitarianism as imposing sameness, stating: ""Men are created different; and a government that ignores this law becomes an unjust government for it sacrifices nobility to mediocrity""",1
"Kirk took as one of the ""canons"" of conservatism the principle that ""civilized society requires orders and classes""Italian scholar Norberto Bobbio argued that the right-wing is inegalitarian compared to the left-wing, as he argued that equality is a relative, not absolute, concept.Right libertarians reject collective or state-imposed equality as undermining reward for personal merit, initiative, and enterpriseIn their view, such imposed equality is unjust, limits personal freedom, and leads to social uniformity and mediocrity.In the view of philosopher Jason Stanley in How Fascism Works, the ""politics of hierarchy"" is one of the hallmarks of fascism, which refers to a ""glorious past"" in which members of the rightfully dominant group sat atop the hierarchy, and attempt to recreate this state of being",1
"    History   According to The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought, the Right has gone through five distinct historical stages: The reactionary right sought a return to aristocracy and established religionThe moderate right distrusted intellectuals and sought limited governmentThe radical right favored a romantic and aggressive form of nationalismThe extreme right proposed anti-immigration policies and implicit racismThe neo-liberal right sought to combine a market economy and economic deregulation with the traditional right-wing beliefs in patriotism, elitism and law and order.The political terms Left and Right were first used in the 18th century, during the French Revolution, in reference to the seating arrangement of the French parliament",1
"Those who sat to the right of the chair of the presiding officer (le président) were generally supportive of the institutions of the monarchist Old RegimeThe original ""Right"" in France was formed in reaction to the ""Left"" and comprised those supporting hierarchy, tradition, and clericalism.: 693  The expression la droite (""the right"") increased in use after the restoration of the monarchy in 1815, when it was applied to the Ultra-royalists.From the 1830s to the 1880s, the Western world's social class structure and economy shifted from nobility and aristocracy towards capitalism",1
"This shift affected centre-right movements such as the British Conservative Party, which responded in support of capitalism.The people of English-speaking countries did not apply the terms right and left to their own politics until the 20th centuryThe term right-wing was originally applied to traditional conservatives, monarchists, and reactionaries; an extension, extreme right-wing, denotes fascism, Nazism, and racial supremacy.Rightist regimes were common in Europe in the Interwar period, 1919–1938    France    The political term right-wing was first used during the French Revolution, when liberal deputies of the Third Estate generally sat to the left of the presiding officer's chair, a custom that began in the Estates General of 1789",1
"The nobility, members of the Second Estate, generally sat to the rightIn the successive legislative assemblies, monarchists who supported the Old Regime were commonly referred to as rightists because they sat on the right sideA major figure on the right was Joseph de Maistre, who argued for an authoritarian form of conservatismThroughout the 19th century, the main line dividing Left and Right in France was between supporters of the republic (often secularists) and supporters of the monarchy (often Catholics)",1
"On the right, the Legitimists and Ultra-royalists held counter-revolutionary views, while the Orléanists hoped to create a constitutional monarchy under their preferred branch of the royal family, which briefly became a reality after the 1830 July RevolutionThe centre-right Gaullists in post-World War II France advocated considerable social spending on education and infrastructure development as well as extensive economic regulation, but limited the wealth redistribution measures characteristic of social democracy    Hungary   The dominance of the political right of inter-war Hungary, after the collapse of a short-lived Communist regime, was described by historian István Deák:  Between 1919 and 1944 Hungary was a rightist country",1
"Forged out of a counter-revolutionary heritage, its governments advocated a ""nationalist Christian"" policy; they extolled heroism, faith, and unity; they despised the French Revolution, and they spurned the liberal and socialist ideologies of the 19th centuryThe governments saw Hungary as a bulwark against bolshevism and bolshevism’s instruments: socialism, cosmopolitanism, and FreemasonryThey perpetrated the rule of a small clique of aristocrats, civil servants, and army officers, and surrounded with adulation the head of the state, the counterrevolutionary Admiral Horthy",1

"Ronald Reagan's election to the presidency in 1980 cemented the alliance between the religious right in the United States and social conservatives.In 2019, the United States populace leaned center-right, with 37% of Americans self-identifying as conservative, compared to 35% moderate and 24% liberalThis was continuing a decades long trend of the country leaning center-right.The United States Department of Homeland Security defines right-wing extremism in the United States as ""broadly divided into those groups, movements, and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups), and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely",1

Types   The meaning of right-wing ""varies across societies, historical epochs, and political systems and ideologies."" According to The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics, in liberal democracies, the political right opposes socialism and social democracyRight-wing parties include conservatives, Christian democrats, classical liberals, and nationalists, as well as fascists on the far-right.British academics Noël O'Sullivan and Roger Eatwell divide the right into five types: reactionary, moderate, radical, extreme, and new",1
"Journalist Chip Berlet wrote that each of these ""styles of thought"" are ""responses to the left"", including liberalism and socialism, which have arisen since the 1789 French RevolutionThe reactionary right looks toward the past and is ""aristocratic, religious and authoritarian""The moderate right, typified by the writings of Edmund Burke, is tolerant of change, provided it is gradual and accepts some aspects of liberalism, including the rule of law and capitalism, although it sees radical laissez-faire and individualism as harmful to society",1
"The moderate right often promotes nationalism and social welfare policiesRadical right is a descriptive term which was developed after World War II and it was applied to groups and ideologies such as McCarthyism, the John Birch Society, Thatcherism, and the Republikaner PartyEatwell stresses that this usage of the term has ""major typological problems"" because it ""has also been applied to clearly democratic developments."" The radical right includes right-wing populism and various other subtypes",1
"The extreme right has four traits: ""1) anti-democracy, 2) nationalism, 3) racism, and 4) the strong state."" The New Right consists of the liberal conservatives, who stress small government, free markets, and individual initiative.Other authors make a distinction between the centre-right and the far-rightParties of the centre-right generally support liberal democracy, capitalism, the market economy (though they may accept government regulation to control monopolies), private property rights, and a limited welfare state (for example, government provision of education and medical care)",1
"They support conservatism and economic liberalism and oppose socialism and communismBy contrast, the phrase ""far-right"" is used to describe those who favor an absolutist government, which uses the power of the state to support the dominant ethnic group or religion and criminalize other ethnic groups or religionsTypical examples of leaders to whom the far-right label is often applied are: Francisco Franco in Spain, Benito Mussolini in Italy, Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany, and Augusto Pinochet in Chile",1

"    Bounded rationality    Bounded rationality is the idea that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the tractability of the decision problem, their cognitive limitations and the time availableDecision-makers in this view act as satisficers, seeking a satisfactory solution rather than an optimal oneHerbert ASimon proposed bounded rationality as an alternative basis for the mathematical modeling of decision-makingIt complements ""rationality as optimization"", which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available",2
"Simon used the analogy of a pair of scissors, where one blade represents human cognitive limitations and the other the ""structures of the environment"", illustrating how minds compensate for limited resources by exploiting known structural regularity in the environmentBounded rationality implicates the idea that humans take shortcuts that may lead to suboptimal decision-makingBehavioral economists engage in mapping the decision shortcuts that agents use in order to help increase the effectiveness of human decision-making",2
One treatment of this idea comes from Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler's NudgeSunstein and Thaler recommend that choice architectures are modified in light of human agents' bounded rationalityA widely cited proposal from Sunstein and Thaler urges that healthier food be placed at sight level in order to increase the likelihood that a person will opt for that choice instead of less healthy optionSome critics of Nudge have lodged attacks that modifying choice architectures will lead to people becoming worse decision-makers,2
"    Prospect theory    In 1979, Kahneman and Tversky published prospect theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk, that used cognitive psychology to explain various divergences of economic decision making from neo-classical theoryProspect theory has two stages: an editing stage and an evaluation stageIn the editing stage, risky situations are simplified using various heuristicsIn the evaluation phase, risky alternatives are evaluated using various psychological principles that include:  Reference dependence: When evaluating outcomes, the decision maker considers a ""reference level""",2
"Outcomes are then compared to the reference point and classified as ""gains"" if greater than the reference point and ""losses"" if less than the reference pointLoss aversion: Losses are avoided more than equivalent gains are soughtIn their 1992 paper, Kahneman and Tversky found the median coefficient of loss aversion to be about 2.25, i.e., losses hurt about 2.25 times more than equivalent gains rewardNon-linear probability weighting: Decision makers overweigh small probabilities and underweigh large probabilities—this gives rise to the inverse-S shaped ""probability weighting function."" Diminishing sensitivity to gains and losses: As the size of the gains and losses relative to the reference point increase in absolute value, the marginal effect on the decision maker's utility or satisfaction falls.Prospect theory is able to explain everything that the two main existing decision theories—expected utility theory and rank dependent utility theory—can explain",2
"Further, prospect theory has been used to explain phenomena that existing decision theories have great difficulty in explainingThese include backward bending labor supply curves, asymmetric price elasticities, tax evasion and co-movement of stock prices and consumptionIn 1992, in the Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, Kahneman and Tversky gave a revised account of prospect theory that they called cumulative prospect theoryThe new theory eliminated the editing phase in prospect theory and focused just on the evaluation phase",2
"Its main feature was that it allowed for non-linear probability weighting in a cumulative manner, which was originally suggested in John Quiggin's rank-dependent utility theoryPsychological traits such as overconfidence, projection bias, and the effects of limited attention are now part of the theoryOther developments include a conference at the University of Chicago, a special behavioral economics edition of the Quarterly Journal of Economics (""In Memory of Amos Tversky""), and Kahneman's 2002 Nobel Prize for having ""integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty.""     Nudge theory    Nudge is a concept in behavioral science, political theory and economics which proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals",2
"Nudging contrasts with other ways to achieve compliance, such as education, legislation or enforcementThe concept has influenced British and American politiciansSeveral nudge units exist around the world at the national level (UK, Germany, Japan and others) as well as at the international level (OECD, World Bank, UN)The first formulation of the term and associated principles was developed in cybernetics by James Wilk before 1995 and described by Brunel University academic D",2
"JStewart as ""the art of the nudge"" (sometimes referred to as micronudges)It also drew on methodological influences from clinical psychotherapy tracing back to Gregory Bateson, including contributions from Milton Erickson, Watzlawick, Weakland and Fisch, and Bill O'HanlonIn this variant, the nudge is a microtargeted design geared towards a specific group of people, irrespective of the scale of intended interventionIn 2008, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein's book Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness brought nudge theory to prominence",2
"It also gained a following among US and UK politicians, in the private sector and in public healthThe authors refer to influencing behavior without coercion as libertarian paternalism and the influencers as choice architects Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as:  A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives",2
"To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoidNudges are not mandatesPutting fruit at eye level counts as a nudgeBanning junk food does not.In this form, drawing on behavioral economics, the nudge is more generally applied to influence behaviorOne of the most frequently cited examples of a nudge is the etching of the image of a housefly into the men's room urinals at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which is intended to ""improve the aim"".Nudging techniques aim to capitalise on the judgemental heuristics of people",2
"In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcomeAn example of such a nudge is switching the placement of junk food in a store, so that fruit and other healthy options are located next to the cash register, while junk food is relocated to another part of the store.In 2008, the United States appointed Sunstein, who helped develop the theory, as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.Notable applications of nudge theory include the formation of the British Behavioural Insights Team in 2010",2
"It is often called the ""Nudge Unit"", at the British Cabinet Office, headed by David HalpernIn addition, the Penn Medicine Nudge Unit is the world's first behavioral design team embedded within a health systemBoth Prime Minister David Cameron and President Barack Obama sought to employ nudge theory to advance domestic policy goals during their terms.In Australia, the government of New South Wales established a Behavioural Insights community of practice.Nudge theory has also been applied to business management and corporate culture, such as in relation to health, safety and environment (HSE) and human resources",2
"Regarding its application to HSE, one of the primary goals of nudge is to achieve a ""zero accident culture"".Leading Silicon Valley companies are forerunners in applying nudge theory in a corporate settingThese companies are using nudges in various forms to increase the productivity and happiness of employeesRecently, further companies are gaining interest in using what is called ""nudge management"" to improve the productivity of their white-collar workers.Behavioral insights and nudges are currently used in many countries around the world",2
"    Criticisms   Citing the example of restaurant hygiene ratings to 'nudge' consumers towards food safety, it has been argued that mere public disclosure of ratings is not sufficient to ensure public health safety and consumers may not understand the actual meaning and expected behavioral change from such ratings.Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation The King's Fund, has said: ""We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which is not based on any good evidence and doesn't help people make long-term behaviour changes.""Cass Sunstein has responded to critiques at length in his The Ethics of Influence making the case in favor of nudging against charges that nudges diminish autonomy, threaten dignity, violate liberties, or reduce welfare",2
"Ethicists have debated this rigorouslyThese charges have been made by various participants in the debate from Bovens  to GoodwinWilkinson for example charges nudges for being manipulative, while others such as Yeung question their scientific credibility.Some, such as Hausman & Welch have inquired whether nudging should be permissible on grounds of (distributive) justice; Lepenies & Malecka have questioned whether nudges are compatible with the rule of lawSimilarly, legal scholars have discussed the role of nudges and the law.Behavioral economists such as Bob Sugden have pointed out that the underlying normative benchmark of nudging is still homo economicus, despite the proponents' claim to the contrary.It has been remarked that nudging is also a euphemism for psychological manipulation as practiced in social engineering.There exists an anticipation and, simultaneously, implicit criticism of the nudge theory in works of Hungarian social psychologists who emphasize the active participation in the nudge of its target (Ferenc Merei and Laszlo Garai)",2
"    Behavioral economics concepts   Conventional economics assumes that all people are both rational and selfishIn practice, this is often not the case, which leads to the failure of traditional modelsBehavioral economics studies the biases, tendencies and heuristics that affect the decisions that people make to improve, tweak or overhaul traditional economic theoryIt aids in determining whether people make good or bad choices and whether they could be helped to make better choices",2
"It can be applied both before and after a decision is made    Search heuristics   Before a decision is made, there needs to be a minimum of two optionsBehavioral economics employs search heuristics to explain how a person may evaluate their optionsSearch heuristics is a school of thought that suggests that when making a choice, it is costly to gain information about options and that methods exist to maximise the utility that one might get from searching for information",2
"While each heuristic is not wholistic in its explanation of the search process alone, a combination of these heuristics may be used in the decision making processThere are three primary search heuristicsSatisficing Satisficing is the idea that there is some minimum requirement from the search and once that has been met, stop searchingFollowing the satisficing heuristic a person may not necessarily acquire the most optimal product (i.ethe one that would grant them the most utility), but would find one that is ""good enough""",2
"This heuristic may be problematic if the aspiration level is set at such a level that no products exist that could meet the requirementsDirected cognition Directed cognition is a search heuristic in which a person treats each opportunity to research information as their lastRather than a contingent plan that indicates what will be done based on the results of each search, directed cognition considers only if one more search should be conducted and what alternative should be researched",2
"Elimination by aspects Whereas satisficing and directed cognition compare choices, elimination by aspects compares certain qualitiesA person using the elimination by aspects heuristic first chooses the quality that they value most in what they are searching for and sets an aspiration levelThis may be repeated to refine the searchi.eidentify the second most valued quality and set an aspiration levelUsing this heuristic, options will be eliminated as they fail to meet the minimum requirements of the chosen qualities",2
"    Heuristics and cognitive effects   Outside of searching, behavioral economists and psychologists have identified a number of other heuristics and other cognitive effects that affect people's decision makingSome of these include: Mental accounting Mental accounting refers to the propensity to allocate resources for specific purposesMental accounting is a behavioral bias that causes one to separate money into different categories known as mental accounts either based on the source or the intention of the money.Anchoring Anchoring describes when people have a mental reference point with which they compare results to",2
"For example, a person who anticipates that the weather on a particular day would be raining, but finds that on the day it is actually clear blue skies, would gain more utility from the pleasant weather because they anticipated that it would be bad.Herd behavior This is a relatively simple bias that reflects the tendency of people to mimic what everyone else is doing and follow the general consensusIt represents the concept of ""wisdom of the crowd"".Framing effects Stereotypes and anecdotes that act as mental filters are referred to in behavioral economics as Framing effects",2
"People may be inclined to make different decisions depending on how choices are presented to them    Biases and fallacies   While heuristics are tactics or mental shortcuts to aid in the decision making process, people are also affected by a number of biases and fallaciesBehavioral economics identifies a number of these biases that negatively affect decision making such as: Present bias Present bias reflects the human tendency to want rewards soonerIt describes people who are more likely to forego a greater payoff in the future in favour of receiving a smaller benefit sooner",2
"An example of this is a smoker who is trying to quitAlthough they know that in the future they will suffer health consequences, the immediate gain from the nicotine hit is more favourable to a person affected by present biasPresent bias is commonly split into people who are aware of their present bias (sophisticated) and those who are not (naive).Gambler's fallacy Also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy, the gambler's fallacy is the unmerited belief that because an event occurs more frequently in the past it is less likely to occur in the future (or vice versa), despite the probability remaining constant",2
"For example, if a coin had been flipped three times and turned up heads every single time, a person influenced by the gambler's fallacy would predict tails simply because of the abnormal number of heads flipped in the past, even though of course the probability of a heads is still 50%.Narrative fallacy Narrative fallacy is undue influence of a presented story or ""narrative""For example, a startup may get funding because investors are swayed by a narrative that sounds plausible, rather than by a more reasoned analysis of available evidence",2
"Loss aversion Loss aversion refers to the tendency to place greater weight on loss than disappointmentIn other words, they are far more likely to try to assign a higher priority on avoiding losses than making investment gainsAs a result, some investors might want a higher payout to compensate for lossesIf the high payout is not likely, they might try to avoid losses altogether even if the investment's risk is acceptable from a rational standpoint.Recency bias When a person places greater expectation on a particular outcome simply because that outcome had just occurred, that person may be affected by recency bias",2
"To return to the coin flipping example, given that the previous one or two flips were heads, a person affected by recency bias would continue to predict that heads would be flipped.Confirmation bias Confirmation bias reflects the tendency to favour information or results that support one's own beliefs or values.Familiarity bias Familiarity bias simply describes the tendency of people to return to what they know and are comfortable withFamiliarity bias discourages affected people from exploring new options and may limit their ability to find an optimal solution.Status quo bias Status quo bias describes the tendency of people to keep things the way they are",2
"It is a particular aversion to change in favor of remaining comfortable with what is known    Behavioral finance   Behavioral finance is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors or financial analystIt assumes that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control and are influenced by their own biasesFor example, behavioral law and economics scholars studying the growth of financial firms' technological capabilities have attributed decision science to irrational consumer decisions.: 1321    It also includes the subsequent effects on the markets",2
"Behavioral Finance attempts to explain the reasoning patterns of investors and measures the influential power of these patterns on the investor's decision makingThe central issue in behavioral finance is explaining why market participants make irrational systematic errors contrary to assumption of rational market participantsSuch errors affect prices and returns, creating market inefficiencies    Traditional finance   The accepted theories of finance are referred to as traditional financeThe foundation of traditional finance is associated with the modern portfolio theory (MPT) and the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH)",2
"Modern portfolio theory is a stock or portfolio's expected return, standard deviation, and its correlation with the other stocks or mutual funds held within the portfolioWith these three concepts, an efficient portfolio can be created for any group of stocks or bondsAn efficient portfolio is a group of stocks that has the maximum (highest) expected return given the amount of risk assumed, contains the lowest possible risk for a given expected return",2
"The efficient-market hypothesis states that all information has already been reflected in a security's price or market value, and that the current price of the stock or bond always trades at its fair valueThe proponents of the traditional theories believe that ""investors should just own the entire market rather than attempting to outperform the market""Behavioral finance has emerged as an alternative to these theories of traditional finance and the behavioral aspects of psychology and sociology are integral catalysts within this field of study",2
"    Evolution   The foundations of behavioral finance can be traced back over 150 yearsSeveral original books written in the 1800s and early 1900s marked the beginning of the behavioral finance schoolOriginally published in 1841, MacKay's Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds presents a chronological timeline of the various panics and schemes throughout historyThis work shows how group behavior applies to the financial markets of todayLe Bon's important work, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, discusses the role of ""crowds"" (also known as crowd psychology) and group behavior as they apply to the fields of behavioral finance, social psychology, sociology, and history",2
Selden's 1912 book Psychology of The Stock Market was one of the first to apply the field of psychology directly to the stock marketThis classic discusses the emotional and psychological forces at work on investors and traders in the financial marketsThese three works along with several others form the foundation of applying psychology and sociology to the field of financeThe foundation of behavioral finance is an area based on an interdisciplinary approach including scholars from the social sciences and business schools,2
"From the liberal arts perspective, this includes the fields of psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics and behavioral economicsOn the business administration side, this covers areas such as management, marketing, finance, technology and accountingCritics contend that behavioral finance is more a collection of anomalies than a true branch of finance and that these anomalies are either quickly priced out of the market or explained by appealing to market microstructure argumentsHowever, individual cognitive biases are distinct from social biases; the former can be averaged out by the market, while the other can create positive feedback loops that drive the market further and further from a ""fair price"" equilibrium",2
"It is observed that, the problem with the general area of behavioral finance is that it only serves as a complement to general economicsSimilarly, for an anomaly to violate market efficiency, an investor must be able to trade against it and earn abnormal profits; this is not the case for many anomaliesA specific example of this criticism appears in some explanations of the equity premium puzzleIt is argued that the cause is entry barriers (both practical and psychological) and that the equity premium should reduce as electronic resources open up the stock market to more traders",2
"In response, others contend that most personal investment funds are managed through superannuation funds, minimizing the effect of these putative entry barriersIn addition, professional investors and fund managers seem to hold more bonds than one would expect given return differentials    Quantitative behavioral finance   Quantitative behavioral finance uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biasesFinancial models Some financial models used in money management and asset valuation incorporate behavioral finance parameters",2
"Examples:  Thaler's model of price reactions to information, with three phases (underreaction, adjustment, and overreaction), creating a price trend.One characteristic of overreaction is that average returns following announcements of good news is lower than following bad newsIn other words, overreaction occurs if the market reacts too strongly or for too long to news, thus requiring an adjustment in the opposite directionAs a result, outperforming assets in one period is likely to underperform in the following period",2
"This also applies to customers' irrational purchasing habitsThe stock image coefficient    Economic reasoning in animals   A handful of comparative psychologists have attempted to demonstrate quasi-economic reasoning in non-human animalsEarly attempts along these lines focus on the behavior of rats and pigeonsThese studies draw on the tenets of comparative psychology, where the main goal is to discover analogs to human behavior in experimentally-tractable non-human animalsThey are also methodologically similar to the work of Ferster and Skinner",2
"Methodological similarities aside, early researchers in non-human economics deviate from behaviorism in their terminologyAlthough such studies are set up primarily in an operant conditioning chamber using food rewards for pecking/bar-pressing behavior, the researchers describe pecking and bar-pressing not in terms of reinforcement and stimulus-response relationships but instead in terms of work, demand, budget, and laborRecent studies have adopted a slightly different approach, taking a more evolutionary perspective, comparing economic behavior of humans to a species of non-human primate, the capuchin monkey",2
"    Animal studies   Many early studies of non-human economic reasoning were performed on rats and pigeons in an operant conditioning chamberThese studies looked at things like peck rate (in the case of the pigeon) and bar-pressing rate (in the case of the rat) given certain conditions of rewardEarly researchers claim, for example, that response pattern (pecking/bar-pressing rate) is an appropriate analogy to human labor supplyResearchers in this field advocate for the appropriateness of using animal economic behavior to understand the elementary components of human economic behavior",2
"In a paper by Battalio, Green, and Kagel, they write,  Space considerations do not permit a detailed discussion of the reasons why economists should take seriously the investigation of economic theories using nonhuman subjects...[Studies of economic behavior in non-human animals] provide a laboratory for identifying, testing, and better understanding general laws of economic behaviorUse of this laboratory is predicated on the fact that behavior, as well as structure, vary continuously across species, and that principles of economic behavior would be unique among behavioral principles if they did not apply, with some variation, of course, to the behavior of nonhumans",2
"    Labor supply   The typical laboratory environment to study labor supply in pigeons is set up as followsPigeons are first deprived of foodSince the animals become hungry, food becomes highly desiredThe pigeons are then placed in an operant conditioning chamber and through orienting and exploring the environment of the chamber they discover that by pecking a small disk located on one side of the chamber, food is delivered to them",2
"In effect, pecking behavior becomes reinforced, as it is associated with foodBefore long, the pigeon pecks at the disk (or stimulus) regularlyIn this circumstance, the pigeon is said to ""work"" for the food by peckingThe food, then, is thought of as the currencyThe value of the currency can be adjusted in several ways, including the amount of food delivered, the rate of food delivery and the type of food delivered (some foods are more desirable than others)",2
"Economic behavior similar to that observed in humans is discovered when the hungry pigeons stop working/work less when the reward is reducedResearchers argue that this is similar to labor supply behavior in humansThat is, like humans (who, even in need, will only work so much for a given wage), the pigeons demonstrate decreases in pecking (work) when the reward (value) is reduced    Demand   In human economics, a typical demand curve has negative slope",2
"This means that as the price of a certain good increase, the amount that consumers are willing and able to purchase decreasesResearchers studying the demand curves of non-human animals, such as rats, also find downward slopesResearchers have studied demand in rats in a manner distinct from studying labor supply in pigeonsSpecifically, in an operant conditioning chamber containing rats as experimental subjects, we require them to press a bar, instead of pecking a small disk, to receive a reward",2
"The reward can be food (reward pellets), water, or a commodity drink such as cherry colaUnlike in previous pigeon studies, where the work analog was pecking and the monetary analog was a reward, the work analog in this experiment is bar-pressingUnder these circumstances, the researchers claim that changing the number of bar presses required to obtain a commodity item is analogous to changing the price of a commodity item in human economics.In effect, results of demand studies in non-human animals show that, as the bar-pressing requirement (cost) increase, the number of times an animal presses the bar equal to or greater than the bar-pressing requirement (payment) decreases",2
"    Applied issues       Intertemporal choice    Behavioral economics has been applied to intertemporal choice, which is defined as making a decision and having the effects of such decision happening in a different timeIntertemporal choice behavior is largely inconsistent, as exemplified by George Ainslie's hyperbolic discounting—one of the prominently studied observations—and further developed by David Laibson, Ted O'Donoghue and Matthew RabinHyperbolic discounting describes the tendency to discount outcomes in the near future more than outcomes in the far future",2
"This pattern of discounting is dynamically inconsistent (or time-inconsistent), and therefore inconsistent with basic models of rational choice, since the rate of discount between time t and t+1 will be low at time t-1 when t is the near future, but high at time t when t is the present and time t+1 is the near futureThis pattern can also be explained through models of sub-additive discounting that distinguish the delay and interval of discounting: people are less patient (per-time-unit) over shorter intervals regardless of when they occur",2
"    Behavioral game theory    Behavioral game theory, invented by Colin Camerer, analyzes interactive strategic decisions and behavior using the methods of game theory, experimental economics, and experimental psychologyExperiments include testing deviations from typical simplifications of economic theory such as the independence axiom and neglect of altruism, fairness, and framing effectsOn the positive side, the method has been applied to interactive learning and social preferencesAs a research program, the subject is a development of the last three decades",2
"    Artificial intelligence    Much of the decisions are more and more made either by human beings with the assistance of artificial intelligent machines or wholly made by these machinesTshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their book, studied the utility of behavioral economics in such situations and concluded that these intelligent machines reduce the impact of bounded rational decision makingIn particular, they observed that these intelligent machines reduce the degree of information asymmetry in the market, improve decision making and thus making markets more rational",2
"The use of AI machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theoriesOther theories where AI has had impact include in rational choice, rational expectations, game theory, Lewis turning point, portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking    Other areas of research   Other branches of behavioral economics enrich the model of the utility function without implying inconsistency in preferencesErnst Fehr, Armin Falk, and Rabin studied fairness, inequity aversion and reciprocal altruism, weakening the neoclassical assumption of perfect selfishness",2
"This work is particularly applicable to wage settingThe work on ""intrinsic motivation by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini and ""identity"" by George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton assumes that agents derive utility from adopting personal and social norms in addition to conditional expected utilityAccording to Aggarwal, in addition to behavioral deviations from rational equilibrium, markets are also likely to suffer from lagged responses, search costs, externalities of the commons, and other frictions making it difficult to disentangle behavioral effects in market behavior.""Conditional expected utility"" is a form of reasoning where the individual has an illusion of control, and calculates the probabilities of external events and hence their utility as a function of their own action, even when they have no causal ability to affect those external events.Behavioral economics caught on among the general public with the success of books such as Dan Ariely's Predictably Irrational",2
"Practitioners of the discipline have studied quasi-public policy topics such as broadband mapping.Applications for behavioral economics include the modeling of the consumer decision-making process for applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning The Silicon Valley-based start-up Singularities is using the AGM postulates proposed by Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson—the formalization of the concepts of beliefs and change for rational entities—in a symbolic logic to create a ""machine learning and deduction engine that uses the latest data science and big data algorithms in order to generate the content and conditional rules (counterfactuals) that capture customer's behaviors and beliefs.""The University of Pennsylvania's Center for Health Incentives & Behavioral Economics (CHIBE) looks at how behavioral economics can improve health outcomes",2
"CHIBE researchers have found evidence that many behavioral economics principles (incentives, patient and clinician nudges, gamification, loss aversion, and more) can be helpful to encourage vaccine uptake, smoking cessation, medication adherence, and physical activity, for example.Applications of behavioral economics also exist in other disciplines, for example in the area of supply chain management    Natural experiments   From a biological point of view, human behaviors are essentially the same during crises accompanied by stock market crashes and during bubble growth when share prices exceed historic highs",2
"During those periods, most market participants see something new for themselves, and this inevitably induces a stress response in them with accompanying changes in their endocrine profiles and motivationsThe result is quantitative and qualitative changes in behaviorThis is one example where behavior affecting economics and finance can be observed and variably-contrasted using behavioral economicsBehavioral economics' usefulness applies beyond environments similar to stock exchangesSelfish-reasoning, 'adult behaviors', and similar, can be identified within criminal-concealment(s), and legal-deficiencies and neglect of different types can be observed and discovered",2
"Awareness of indirect consequence (or lack of), at least in potential with different experimental models and methods, can be used as well—behavioral economics' potential uses are broad, but its reliability needs scrutinyUnderestimation of the role of novelty as a stressor is the primary shortcoming of current approaches for market researchIt is necessary to account for the biologically determined diphasisms of human behavior in everyday low-stress conditions and in response to stressors",2
"Limitations of experimental methods (e.grandomized control trials) and their use in economics were famously analyzed by Angus Deaton    Criticism   Experimental psychological work by Kahneman and Tversky published in Armen Alchian's 1950 paper ""Uncertainty, Evolution, and Economic Theory"" and Gary Becker's 1962 paper ""Irrational Behavior and Economic Theory"", both of which were published in the Journal of Political Economy, provide a justification for standard neoclassical economic analysisAlchian's 1950 paper uses the logic of natural selection, stochastic processes, probability theory, and several other lines of reasoning to justify many of the results derived from standard supply analysis assuming firms which maximizing their profits, are certain about the future, and have accurate foresight without having to assume any of those things",2
"Becker's 1962 paper shows that downward sloping market demand curves do not actually require an assumption that the consumers in that market are rational, as is claimed by behavioral economists and they also follow from a wide variety of irrational behavior as wellThe two papers laid the groundwork for Richard Thaler's workCritics of behavioral economics typically stress the rationality of economic agentsA fundamental critique is provided by Maialeh (2019) who argues that no behavioral research can establish an economic theory",2
"Examples provided on this account include pillars of behavioral economics such as satisficing behavior or prospect theory, which are confronted from the neoclassical perspective of utility maximization and expected utility theory respectivelyThe author shows that behavioral findings are hardly generalizable and that they do not disprove typical mainstream axioms related to rational behavior.Others, such as the essayist and former trader Nassim Taleb note that cognitive theories, such as prospect theory, are models of decision-making, not generalized economic behavior, and are only applicable to the sort of once-off decision problems presented to experiment participants or survey respondents",2
"Others argue that decision-making models, such as the endowment effect theory, that have been widely accepted by behavioral economists may be erroneously established as a consequence of poor experimental design practices that do not adequately control subject misconceptions.Despite a great deal of rhetoric, no unified behavioral theory has yet been espoused: behavioral economists have proposed no alternative unified theory of their own to replace neoclassical economics withDavid Gal has argued that many of these issues stem from behavioral economics being too concerned with understanding how behavior deviates from standard economic models rather than with understanding why people behave the way they do",2
"Understanding why behavior occurs is necessary for the creation of generalizable knowledge, the goal of scienceHe has referred to behavioral economics as a ""triumph of marketing"" and particularly cited the example of loss aversion.Traditional economists are skeptical of the experimental and survey-based techniques that behavioral economics uses extensivelyEconomists typically stress revealed preferences over stated preferences (from surveys) in the determination of economic valueExperiments and surveys are at risk of systemic biases, strategic behavior and lack of incentive compatibility",2
"Some researchers point out that participants of experiments conducted by behavioral economists are not representative enough and drawing broad conclusions on the basis of such experiments is not possibleAn acronym WEIRD has been coined in order to describe the studies participants - as those, who come from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic societies    Responses   Matthew Rabin dismisses these criticisms, countering that consistent results typically are obtained in multiple situations and geographies and can produce good theoretical insight",2
"Behavioral economists, however, responded to these criticisms by focusing on field studies rather than lab experimentsSome economists see a fundamental schism between experimental economics and behavioral economics, but prominent behavioral and experimental economists tend to share techniques and approaches in answering common questionsFor example, behavioral economists are investigating neuroeconomics, which is entirely experimental and has not been verified in the field.The epistemological, ontological, and methodological components of behavioral economics are increasingly debated, in particular by historians of economics and economic methodologists.According to some researchers, when studying the mechanisms that form the basis of decision-making, especially financial decision-making, it is necessary to recognize that most decisions are made under stress because, ""Stress is the nonspecific body response to any demands presented to it.""     Related Fields       Experimental economics    Experimental economics is the application of experimental methods, including statistical, econometric, and computational, to study economic questions",2
"Data collected in experiments are used to estimate effect size, test the validity of economic theories, and illuminate market mechanismsEconomic experiments usually use cash to motivate subjects, in order to mimic real-world incentivesExperiments are used to help understand how and why markets and other exchange systems function as they doExperimental economics have also expanded to understand institutions and the law (experimental law and economics).A fundamental aspect of the subject is design of experiments",2
" Experiments may be conducted in the field or in laboratory settings, whether of individual or group behavior.Variants of the subject outside such formal confines include natural and quasi-natural experiments    Neuroeconomics    Neuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to explain human decision making, the ability to process multiple alternatives and to follow a course of actionIt studies how economic behavior can shape our understanding of the brain, and how neuroscientific discoveries can constrain and guide models of economics",2
"It combines research methods from neuroscience, experimental and behavioral economics, and cognitive and social psychologyAs research into decision-making behavior becomes increasingly computational, it has also incorporated new approaches from theoretical biology, computer science, and mathematics Neuroeconomics studies decision making by using a combination of tools from these fields so as to avoid the shortcomings that arise from a single-perspective approachIn mainstream economics, expected utility (EU) and the concept of rational agents are still being used",2
"Many economic behaviors are not fully explained by these models, such as heuristics and framingBehavioral economics emerged to account for these anomalies by integrating social, cognitive, and emotional factors in understanding economic decisionsNeuroeconomics adds another layer by using neuroscientific methods in understanding the interplay between economic behavior and neural mechanismsBy using tools from various fields, some scholars claim that neuroeconomics offers a more integrative way of understanding decision making",2
"    Evolutionary psychology    An evolutionary psychology perspective states that many of the perceived limitations in rational choice can be explained as being rational in the context of maximizing biological fitness in the ancestral environment, but not necessarily in the current oneThus, when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may result in death, it may have been rational to place a greater value on preventing losses than on obtaining gains",2
"An economy (from Ancient Greek  οἰκονομία (oikonomía) 'management of a household, administration'; from  οἶκος (oîkos) 'household', and  νέμω (némō) 'distribute, allocate') is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services by different agentsIn general, it is defined  'as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of scarce resources'A given economy is a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure and legal systems, as well as its geography, natural resource endowment, and ecology, as main factors",2
"These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functionsIn other words, the economic domain is a social domain of interrelated human practices and transactions that does not stand aloneEconomic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governmentsEconomic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency",2
"However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domainEconomic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capitalIt has changed over time due to technology, innovation (new products, services, processes, expanding markets, diversification of markets, niche markets, increases revenue functions) such as, that which produces intellectual property and changes in industrial relations (most notably child labor being replaced in some parts of the world with universal access to education)",2
"A market-based economy is one where goods and services are produced and exchanged according to demand and supply between participants (economic agents) by barter or a medium of exchange with a credit or debit value accepted within the network, such as a unit of currencyA command-based economy is one where political agents directly control what is produced and how it is sold and distributedA green economy is low-carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive",2
"In a green economy, growth in income and employment is driven by public and private investments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance energy and resource efficiency, and prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem servicesA gig economy is one in which short-term jobs are assigned or chosen via online platformsNew economy is a term that referred to the whole emerging ecosystem where new standards and practices were introduced, usually as a result of technological innovations",2
"The global economy refers to humanity's economic system or systems overall    Range    Today the range of fields of study examining the economy revolves around the social science of economics, but may include sociology (economic sociology), history (economic history), anthropology (economic anthropology), and geography (economic geography)Practical fields directly related to the human activities involving production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services as a whole are engineering, management, business administration, applied science, and finance",2
"All professions, occupations, economic agents or economic activities, contribute to the economyConsumption, saving, and investment are variable components in the economy that determine macroeconomic equilibriumThere are three main sectors of economic activity: primary, secondary, and tertiaryDue to the growing importance of the financial sector in modern times, the term real economy is used by analysts as well as politicians to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with the actual production of goods and services, as ostensibly  contrasted with the paper economy, or the financial side of the economy, which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets",2
"Alternate and long-standing terminology distinguishes measures of an economy expressed in real values (adjusted for inflation), such as real GDP, or in nominal values (unadjusted for inflation)    Etymology   The English words ""economy"" and ""economics"" can be traced back to the Greek word οἰκονόμος (i.e""household management""), a composite word derived from οἶκος (""house;household;home"") and νέμω (""manage; distribute;to deal out;dispense"") by way of οἰκονομία (""household management"")The first recorded sense of the word ""economy"" is in the phrase ""the management of œconomic affairs"", found in a work possibly composed in a monastery in 1440",2
"""Economy"" is later recorded in more general senses, including ""thrift"" and ""administration""The most frequently used current sense, denoting ""the economic system of a country or an area"", seems not to have developed until the 1650s    History       Ancient times    As long as someone has been making, supplying and distributing goods or services, there has been some sort of economy; economies grew larger as societies grew and became more complexSumer developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money, while the Babylonians and their neighboring city states later developed the earliest system of economics as we think of, in terms of rules/laws on debt, legal contracts and law codes relating to business practices, and private property.The Babylonians and their city state neighbors developed forms of economics comparable to currently used civil society (law) concepts",2
"They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government recordsThe ancient economy was mainly based on subsistence farmingThe Shekel referred to an ancient unit of weight and currencyThe first usage of the term came from Mesopotamia circa 3000 BCand referred to a specific mass of barley which related other values in a metric such as silver, bronze, copper etcA barley/shekel was originally both a unit of currency and a unit of weight, just as the British Pound was originally a unit denominating a one-pound mass of silver",2
"For most people, the exchange of goods occurred through social relationshipsThere were also traders who bartered in the marketplacesIn Ancient Greece, where the present English word 'economy' originated, many people were bond slaves of the freeholdersThe economic discussion was driven by scarcity    Middle ages    In Medieval times, What is now known as an economy was not far from the subsistence levelMost exchange occurred within social groupsOn top of this, the great conquerors raised what we now call venture capital (from ventura, ital.; risk) to finance their captures",2
"The capital should be refunded by the goods they would bring up in the New WorldThe discoveries of Marco Polo (1254–1324), Christopher Columbus (1451–1506) and Vasco da Gama (1469–1524) led to a first global economyThe first enterprises were trading establishmentsIn 1513, the first stock exchange was founded in AntwerpEconomy at the time meant primarily trade    Early modern times    The European captures became branches of the European states, the so-called colonies",2
"The rising nation-states Spain, Portugal, France, Great Britain and the Netherlands tried to control the trade through custom duties and (from mercator, lat.: merchant) was a first approach to intermediate between private wealth and public interestThe secularization in Europe allowed states to use the immense property of the church for the development of townsThe influence of the nobles decreasedThe first Secretaries of State for economy started their workBankers like Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773–1855) started to finance national projects such as wars and infrastructure",2
"Economy from then on meant national economy as a topic for the economic activities of the citizens of a state    Industrial Revolution    The first economist in the true modern meaning of the word was the Scotsman Adam Smith (1723–1790) who was inspired partly by the ideas of  physiocracy,  a reaction to mercantilism and also later Economics student, Adam MariHe defined the elements of a national economy: products are offered at a natural price generated by the use of competition - supply and demand - and the division of labor",2
"He maintained that the basic motive for free trade is human self-interestThe so-called self-interest hypothesis became the anthropological basis for economicsThomas Malthus (1766–1834) transferred the idea of supply and demand to the problem of overpopulationThe Industrial Revolution was a period from the 18th to the 19th century where major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions starting in the United Kingdom, then subsequently spreading throughout Europe, North America, and eventually the world",2
"The onset of the Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was eventually influenced in some wayIn Europe wild capitalism started to replace the system of mercantilism (today: protectionism) and led to economic growthThe period today is called industrial revolution because the system of Production, production and division of labor enabled the mass production of goods    Recognition of the concept of ""the economy""   The contemporary concept of ""the economy"" wasn't popularly known until the American Great Depression in the 1930s.After the chaos of two World Wars and the devastating Great Depression, policymakers searched for new ways of controlling the course of the economy",2
"This was explored and discussed by Friedrich August von Hayek (1899–1992) and Milton Friedman (1912–2006) who pleaded for a global free trade and are supposed to be the fathers of the so-called neoliberalismHowever, the prevailing view was that held by John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), who argued for a stronger control of the markets by the stateThe theory that the state can alleviate economic problems and instigate economic growth through state manipulation of aggregate demand is called Keynesianism in his honor",2
"In the late 1950s, the economic growth in America and Europe—often called Wirtschaftswunder (ger: economic miracle) —brought up a new form of economy: mass consumption economyIn 1958, John Kenneth Galbraith (1908–2006) was the first to speak of an affluent societyIn most of the countries the economic system is called a social market economy    Late 20th – beginning of 21st century    With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the transition of the countries of the Eastern Bloc towards democratic government and market economies, the idea of the post-industrial society is brought into importance as its role is to mark together the significance that the service sector receives instead of industrialization",2
"Some attribute the first use of this term to Daniel Bell's 1973 book, The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, while others attribute it to social philosopher Ivan Illich's book, Tools for ConvivialityThe term is also applied in philosophy to designate the fading of postmodernism in the late 90s and especially in the beginning of the 21st centuryWith the spread of Internet as a mass media and communication medium especially after 2000-2001, the idea for the Internet and information economy is given place because of the growing importance of e-commerce and electronic businesses, also the term for a global information society as understanding of a new type of ""all-connected"" society is created",2

"The economic growth took place mostly in mining, construction and manufacturing industriesCommerce became more significant due to the need for improved exchange and distribution of produce throughout the communityIn the economies of modern consumer societies phase there is a growing part played by services, finance, and technology—the knowledge economy.In modern economies, these phase precedences are somewhat differently expressed by the three-sector theoryPrimary stage/degree of the economy: Involves the extraction and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron",2
"(A coal miner and a fisherman would be workers in the primary degree.) Secondary stage/degree of the economy: Involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.gmanufacturing steel into cars, or textiles into clothing(A builder and a dressmaker would be workers in the secondary degree.) At this stage the associated industrial economy is also sub-divided into several economic sectors (also called industries)Their separate evolution during the Industrial Revolution phase is dealt with elsewhere",2
"Tertiary stage/degree of the economy: Involves the provision of services to consumers and businesses, such as baby-sitting, cinema and banking(A shopkeeper and an accountant would be workers in the tertiary degree.) Quaternary stage/degree of the economy: Involves the research and development needed to produce products from natural resources and their subsequent by-products(A logging company might research ways to use partially burnt wood to be processed so that the undamaged portions of it can be made into pulp for paper.) Note that education is sometimes included in this sector.Other sectors of the developed community include :  the public sector or state sector (which usually includes: parliament, law-courts and government centers, various emergency services, public health, shelters for impoverished and threatened people, transport facilities, air/sea ports, post-natal care, hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, preserved historical buildings, parks/gardens, nature-reserves, some universities, national sports grounds/stadiums, national arts/concert-halls or theaters and centers for various religions)",2
"the private sector or privately run businessesthe social sector or voluntary sector    Economic measures   The main indicators used to monitor the performance of an economy are:     GDP   The GDP (gross domestic product) of a country is a measure of the size of its economyThe most conventional economic analysis of a country relies heavily on economic indicators like the GDP and GDP per capitaWhile often useful, GDP only includes economic activity for which money is exchanged",2
"    Informal economy    An informal economy is the set of economic activities operating as to partially avoid being taxed or regulated, in contrast to a formal economyThe informal economy is thus not included in that government's gross national product (GNP)Although the informal economy is often associated with developing countries, all economic systems contain an informal economy in some proportionInformal economic activity is a dynamic process that includes many aspects of economic and social theory including exchange, regulation, and enforcement",2
"By its nature, it is necessarily difficult to observe, study, define, and measureNo single source readily or authoritatively defines informal economy as a unit of studyThe terms ""underground"", ""under the table"" and ""off the books"" typically refer to this type of economyThe term black market refers to a specific subset of the informal economyThe term ""informal sector"" was used in many earlier studies, and has been mostly replaced in more recent studies which use the newer term",2
"The informal sector makes up a significant portion of the economies in developing countries but it is often stigmatized as troublesome and unmanageableHowever, the informal sector provides critical economic opportunities for the poor and has been expanding rapidly since the 1960sAs such, integrating the informal economy into the formal sector is an important policy challenge    Economic research    Economic research is conducted in fields as different as agricultural, development, econometrics, environmental, game theory, industrial organization, international, labor, macroeconomics, mathematical, monetary, public, regional and urban, education, and economics history",2

"Keynesian economics ( KAYN-zee-ən; sometimes Keynesianism, named after British economist John Maynard Keynes) are the various macroeconomic theories and models of how aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) strongly influences economic output and inflationIn the Keynesian view, aggregate demand does not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the economyInstead, it is influenced by a host of factors – sometimes behaving erratically – affecting production, employment, and inflation.Keynesian economists generally argue that aggregate demand is volatile and unstable and that, consequently, a market economy often experiences inefficient macroeconomic outcomes – a recession, when demand is low, and inflation, when demand is high",2
"Further, they argue that these economic fluctuations can be mitigated by economic policy responses coordinated between government and central bankIn particular, fiscal policy actions (taken by the government) and  monetary policy actions (taken by the central bank), can help stabilize economic output, inflation, and unemployment over the business cycleKeynesian economists generally advocate a market economy – predominantly private sector, but with an active role for government intervention during recessions and depressions.Keynesian economics developed during and after the Great Depression from the ideas presented by Keynes in his 1936 book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money",2
"Keynes' approach was a stark contrast to the aggregate supply-focused classical economics that preceded his bookInterpreting Keynes's work is a contentious topic, and several schools of economic thought claim his legacyKeynesian economics, as part of the neoclassical synthesis, served as the standard macroeconomic model in the developed nations during the later part of the Great Depression, World War II, and the post-war economic expansion (1945–1973)It lost some influence following the oil shock and resulting stagflation of the 1970s",2
"Keynesian economics was later redeveloped as New Keynesian economics, becoming part of the contemporary new neoclassical synthesis, that forms one current-day theory on  macroeconomicsThe advent of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 sparked renewed interest in Keynesian thought    Historical context       Pre-Keynesian macroeconomics   Macroeconomics is the study of the factors applying to an economy as a wholeImportant macroeconomic variables include the overall price level, the interest rate, the level of employment, and income (or equivalently output) measured in real terms",2
"The classical tradition of partial equilibrium theory had been to split the economy into separate markets, each of whose equilibrium conditions could be stated as a single equation determining a single variableThe theoretical apparatus of supply and demand curves developed by Fleeming Jenkin and Alfred Marshall provided a unified mathematical basis for this approach, which the Lausanne School generalized to general equilibrium theoryFor macroeconomics, relevant partial theories included the Quantity theory of money determining the price level and the classical theory of the interest rate",2
"In regards to employment, the condition referred to by Keynes as the ""first postulate of classical economics"" stated that the wage is equal to the marginal product, which is a direct application of the marginalist principles developed during the nineteenth century (see The General Theory)Keynes sought to supplant all three aspects of the classical theory    Precursors of Keynesianism    Although Keynes's work was crystallized and given impetus by the advent of the Great Depression, it was part of a long-running debate within economics over the existence and nature of general gluts",2
"A number of the policies Keynes advocated to address the Great Depression (notably government deficit spending at times of low private investment or consumption), and many of the theoretical ideas he proposed (effective demand, the multiplier, the paradox of thrift), had been advanced by authors in the 19th and early 20th centuries(E.gJMRobertson raised the paradox of thrift in 1892.) Keynes's unique contribution was to provide a general theory of these, which proved acceptable to the economic establishment",2
"An intellectual precursor of Keynesian economics was underconsumption theories associated with John Law, Thomas Malthus, the Birmingham School of Thomas Attwood, and the American economists William Trufant Foster and Waddill Catchings, who were influential in the 1920s and 1930sUnderconsumptionists were, like Keynes after them, concerned with failure of aggregate demand to attain potential output, calling this ""underconsumption"" (focusing on the demand side), rather than ""overproduction"" (which would focus on the supply side), and advocating economic interventionism",2
"Keynes specifically discussed underconsumption (which he wrote ""under-consumption"") in the General Theory, in Chapter 22, Section IV and Chapter 23, Section VIINumerous concepts were developed earlier and independently of Keynes by the Stockholm school during the 1930s; these accomplishments were described in a 1937 article, published in response to the 1936 General Theory, sharing the Swedish discoveries    Keynes's early writings   In 1923 Keynes published his first contribution to economic theory, A Tract on Monetary Reform, whose point of view is classical but incorporates ideas that later played a part in the General Theory",2
" In particular, looking at the hyperinflation in European economies, he drew attention to the opportunity cost of holding money (identified with inflation rather than interest) and its influence on the velocity of circulation.In 1930 he published A Treatise on Money, intended as a comprehensive treatment of its subject ""which would confirm his stature as a serious academic scholar, rather than just as the author of stinging polemics"", and marks a large step in the direction of his later views",2
"In it, he attributes unemployment to wage stickiness and treats saving and investment as governed by independent decisions: the former varying positively with the interest rate, the latter negativelyThe velocity of circulation is expressed as a function of the rate of interestHe interpreted his treatment of liquidity as implying a purely monetary theory of interest.Keynes's younger colleagues of the Cambridge Circus and Ralph Hawtrey believed that his arguments implicitly assumed full employment, and this influenced the direction of his subsequent work",2
"During 1933, he wrote essays on various economic topics ""all of which are cast in terms of movement of output as a whole""    Development of The General Theory   At the time that Keynes's wrote the General Theory, it had been a tenet of mainstream economic thought that the economy would automatically revert to a state of general equilibrium: it had been assumed that, because the needs of consumers are always greater than the capacity of the producers to satisfy those needs, everything that is produced would eventually be consumed once the appropriate price was found for it",2
"This perception is reflected in Say's law and in the writing of David Ricardo, which states that individuals produce so that they can either consume what they have manufactured or sell their output so that they can buy someone else's outputThis argument rests upon the assumption that if a surplus of goods or services exists, they would naturally drop in price to the point where they would be consumedGiven the backdrop of high and persistent unemployment during the Great Depression, Keynes argued that there was no guarantee that the goods that individuals produce would be met with adequate effective demand, and periods of high unemployment could be expected, especially when the economy was contracting in size",2
"He saw the economy as unable to maintain itself at full employment automatically, and believed that it was necessary for the government to step in and put purchasing power into the hands of the working population through government spendingThus, according to Keynesian theory, some individually rational microeconomic-level actions such as not investing savings in the goods and services produced by the economy, if taken collectively by a large proportion of individuals and firms, can lead to outcomes wherein the economy operates below its potential output and growth rate",2
"Prior to Keynes, a situation in which aggregate demand for goods and services did not meet supply was referred to by classical economists as a general glut, although there was disagreement among them as to whether a general glut was possible Keynes argued that when a glut occurred, it was the over-reaction of producers and the laying off of workers that led to a fall in demand and perpetuated the problemKeynesians therefore advocate an active stabilization policy to reduce the amplitude of the business cycle, which they rank among the most serious of economic problems",2
"According to the theory, government spending can be used to increase aggregate demand, thus increasing economic activity, reducing unemployment and deflation    Origins of the multiplier   The Liberal Party fought the 1929 General Election on a promise to ""reduce levels of unemployment to normal within one year by utilising the stagnant labour force in vast schemes of national development""David Lloyd George launched his campaign in March with a policy document, We can cure unemployment, which tentatively claimed that, ""Public works would lead to a second round of spending as the workers spent their wages."" Two months later Keynes, then nearing completion of his Treatise on money, and Hubert Henderson collaborated on a political pamphlet seeking to ""provide academically respectable economic arguments"" for Lloyd George's policies",2
"It was titled Can Lloyd George do it? and endorsed the claim that ""greater trade activity would make for greater trade activity ..with a cumulative effect""This became the mechanism of the ""ratio"" published by Richard Kahn in his 1931 paper ""The relation of home investment to unemployment"", described by Alvin Hansen as ""one of the great landmarks of economic analysis""The ""ratio"" was soon rechristened the ""multiplier"" at Keynes's suggestion.The multiplier of Kahn's paper is based on a respending mechanism familiar nowadays from textbooks",2
"Samuelson puts it as follows:  Let’s suppose that I hire unemployed resources to build a $1000 woodshedMy carpenters and lumber producers will get an extra $1000 of income..If they all have a marginal propensity to consume of 2/3, they will now spend $666.67 on new consumption goodsThe producers of these goods will now have extra incomes..they in turn will spend $444.44 ..Thus an endless chain of secondary consumption respending  is set in motion by my primary  investment of $1000",2
"Samuelson's treatment closely follows Joan Robinson's account of 1937 and is the main channel by which the multiplier has influenced Keynesian theoryIt differs significantly from Kahn's paper and even more from Keynes's bookThe designation of the initial spending as ""investment"" and the employment-creating respending as ""consumption"" echoes Kahn faithfully, though he gives no reason why initial consumption or subsequent investment respending shouldn't have exactly the same effectsHenry Hazlitt, who considered Keynes as much a culprit as Kahn and Samuelson, wrote that ..",2
" ..in connection with the multiplier (and indeed most of the time) what Keynes is referring to as ""investment"" really means any addition to spending for any purpose.. The word ""investment"" is being used in a Pickwickian, or Keynesian, senseKahn envisaged money as being passed from hand to hand, creating employment at each step, until it came to rest in a cul-de-sac  (Hansen's term was ""leakage""); the only culs-de-sac  he acknowledged were imports and hoarding, although he also said that a rise in prices might dilute the multiplier effect",2
"Jens Warming recognised that personal saving had to be considered, treating it as a ""leakage"" (p214) while recognising on p217 that it might in fact be investedThe textbook multiplier gives the impression that making society richer is the easiest thing in the world: the government just needs to spend moreIn Kahn's paper, it is harderFor him, the initial expenditure must not be a diversion of funds from other uses, but an increase in the total expenditure: something impossible – if understood in real terms – under the classical theory that the level of expenditure is limited by the economy's income/output",2
"On page 174, Kahn rejects the claim that the effect of public works is at the expense of expenditure elsewhere, admitting that this might arise if the revenue is raised by taxation, but says that other available means have no such consequencesAs an example, he suggests that the money may be raised by borrowing from banks, since .. ..it is always within the power of the banking system to advance to the Government the cost of the roads without in any way affecting the flow of investment along the normal channels",2
"This assumes that banks are free to create resources to answer any demandBut Kahn adds that .. ..no such hypothesis is really necessaryFor it will be demonstrated later on that, pari passu  with the building of roads, funds are released from various sources at precisely the rate that is required to pay the cost of the roadsThe demonstration relies on ""Mr Meade's relation"" (due to James Meade) asserting that the total amount of money that disappears into culs-de-sac  is equal to the original outlay, which in Kahn's words ""should bring relief and consolation to those who are worried about the monetary sources"" (p",2
"189)A respending multiplier had been proposed earlier by Hawtrey in a 1928 Treasury memorandum (""with imports as the only leakage""), but the idea was discarded in his own subsequent writingsSoon afterwards the Australian economist Lyndhurst Giblin published a multiplier analysis in a 1930 lecture (again with imports as the only leakage)The idea itself was much olderSome Dutch mercantilists had believed in an infinite multiplier for military expenditure (assuming no import ""leakage""), since ..",2
" ..a war could support itself for an unlimited period if only money remained in the country ..For if money itself is ""consumed"", this simply means that it passes into someone else's possession, and this process may continue indefinitelyMultiplier doctrines had subsequently been expressed in more theoretical terms by the Dane Julius Wulff (1896), the Australian Alfred de Lissa (late 1890s), the German/American Nicholas Johannsen (same period), and the Dane Fr",2
"Johannsen (1925/1927)Kahn himself said that the idea was given to him as a child by his father    Public policy debates   As the 1929 election approached ""Keynes was becoming a strong public advocate of capital development"" as a public measure to alleviate unemploymentWinston Churchill, the Conservative Chancellor, took the opposite view:  It is the orthodox Treasury dogma, steadfastly held ..[that] very little additional employment and no permanent additional employment can, in fact, be created by State borrowing and State expenditure",2
"Keynes pounced on a flaw in the Treasury viewCross-examining Sir Richard Hopkins, a Second Secretary in the Treasury, before the Macmillan Committee on Finance and Industry in 1930 he referred to the ""first proposition"" that ""schemes of capital development are of no use for reducing unemployment"" and asked whether ""it would be a misunderstanding of the Treasury view to say that they hold to the first proposition""Hopkins responded that ""The first proposition goes much too far",2
"The first proposition would ascribe to us an absolute and rigid dogma, would it not?""Later the same year, speaking in a newly created Committee of Economists, Keynes tried to use Kahn's emerging multiplier theory to argue for public works, ""but Pigou's and Henderson's objections ensured that there was no sign of this in the final product""In 1933 he gave wider publicity to his support for Kahn's multiplier in a series of articles titled ""The road to prosperity"" in The Times newspaper.A",2
"CPigou was at the time the sole economics professor at CambridgeHe had a continuing interest in the subject of unemployment, having expressed the view in his popular Unemployment  (1913) that it was caused by ""maladjustment between wage-rates and demand"" – a view Keynes may have shared prior to the years of the General TheoryNor were his practical recommendations very different: ""on many occasions in the thirties"" Pigou ""gave public support ..",2
"to State action designed to stimulate employment""Where the two men differed is in the link between theory and practiceKeynes was seeking to build theoretical foundations to support his recommendations for public works while Pigou showed no disposition to move away from classical doctrineReferring to him and Dennis Robertson, Keynes asked rhetorically: ""Why do they insist on maintaining theories from which their own practical conclusions cannot possibly follow?""     The General Theory    Keynes set forward the ideas that became the basis for Keynesian economics in his main work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936)",2
"It was written during the Great Depression, when unemployment rose to 25% in the United States and as high as 33% in some countriesIt is almost wholly theoretical, enlivened by occasional passages of satire and social commentaryThe book had a profound impact on economic thought, and ever since it was published there has been debate over its meaning    Keynes and classical economics   Keynes begins the General Theory  with a summary of the classical theory of employment, which he encapsulates in his formulation of Say's Law as the dictum ""Supply creates its own demand""",2
"Under the classical theory, the wage rate is determined by the marginal productivity of labour, and as many people are employed as are willing to work at that rateUnemployment may arise through friction or may be ""voluntary,"" in the sense that it arises from a refusal to accept employment owing to ""legislation or social practices ..or mere human obstinacy"", but ""...the classical postulates do not admit of the possibility of the third category,"" which Keynes defines as involuntary unemployment.Keynes raises two objections to the classical theory's assumption that ""wage bargains ..",2
"determine the real wage""The first lies in the fact that ""labour stipulates (within limits) for a money-wage rather than a real wage""The second is that classical theory assumes that, ""The real wages of labour depend on the wage bargains which labour makes with the entrepreneurs,"" whereas, ""If money wages change, one would have expected the classical school to argue that prices would change in almost the same proportion, leaving the real wage and the level of unemployment practically the same as before."" Keynes considers his second objection the more fundamental, but most commentators concentrate on his first one: it has been argued that the quantity theory of money protects the classical school from the conclusion Keynes expected from it",2
"    Keynesian unemployment        Saving and investment    Saving is that part of income not devoted to consumption, and consumption is that part of expenditure not allocated to investment, i.e., to durable goodsHence saving encompasses hoarding (the accumulation of income as cash) and the purchase of durable goodsThe existence of net hoarding, or of a demand to hoard, is not admitted by the simplified liquidity preference model of the General TheoryOnce he rejects the classical theory that unemployment is due to excessive wages, Keynes proposes an alternative based on the relationship between saving and investment",2
"In his view, unemployment arises whenever entrepreneurs' incentive to invest fails to keep pace with society's propensity to save (propensity is one of Keynes's synonyms for ""demand"")The levels of saving and investment are necessarily equal, and income is therefore held down to a level where the desire to save is no greater than the incentive to investThe incentive to invest arises from the interplay between the physical circumstances of production and psychological anticipations of future profitability; but once these things are given the incentive is independent of income and depends solely on the rate of interest r",2
"Keynes designates its value as a function of r  as the ""schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital"".The propensity to save behaves quite differentlySaving is simply that part of income not devoted to consumption, and:  ..the prevailing psychological law seems to be that when aggregate income increases, consumption expenditure will also increase but to a somewhat lesser extentKeynes adds that ""this psychological law was of the utmost importance in the development of my own thought""",2
"     Liquidity preference     Keynes viewed the money supply as one of the main determinants of the state of the real economyThe significance he attributed to it is one of the innovative features of his work, and was influential on the politically hostile monetarist schoolMoney supply comes into play through the liquidity preference function, which is the demand function that corresponds to money supplyIt specifies the amount of money people will seek to hold according to the state of the economy",2
"In Keynes's first (and simplest) account – that of Chapter 13 – liquidity preference is determined solely by the interest rate r—which is seen as the earnings forgone by holding wealth in liquid form: hence liquidity preference can be written L(r ) and in equilibrium must equal the externally fixed money supply M̂     Keynes’s economic model    Money supply, saving and investment combine to determine the level of income as illustrated in the diagram, where the top graph shows money supply (on the vertical axis) against interest rate",2
"M̂  determines the ruling interest rate r̂  through the liquidity preference functionThe rate of interest determines the level of investment Î  through the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, shown as a blue curve in the lower graphThe red curves in the same diagram show what the propensities to save are for different incomes Y ; and the income Ŷ  corresponding to the equilibrium state of the economy must be the one for which the implied level of saving at the established interest rate is equal to Î",2
"In Keynes's more complicated liquidity preference theory (presented in Chapter 15) the demand for money depends on income as well as on the interest rate and the analysis becomes more complicatedKeynes never fully integrated his second liquidity preference doctrine with the rest of his theory, leaving that to John Hicks: see the IS-LM model below     Wage rigidity    Keynes rejects the classical explanation of unemployment based on wage rigidity, but it is not clear what effect the wage rate has on unemployment in his system",2
"He treats wages of all workers as proportional to a single rate set by collective bargaining, and chooses his units so that this rate never appears separately in his discussionIt is present implicitly in those quantities he expresses in wage units, while being absent from those he expresses in money termsIt is therefore difficult to see whether, and in what way, his results differ for a different wage rate, nor is it clear what he thought about the matter",2
"    Remedies for unemployment        Monetary remedies    An increase in the money supply, according to Keynes's theory, leads to a drop in the interest rate and an increase in the amount of investment that can be undertaken profitably, bringing with it an increase in total income     Fiscal remedies    Keynes' name is associated with fiscal, rather than monetary, measures but they receive only passing (and often satirical) reference in the General TheoryHe mentions ""increased public works"" as an example of something that brings employment through the multiplier, but this is before he develops the relevant theory, and he does not follow up when he gets to the theory",2
"Later in the same chapter he tells us that:  Ancient Egypt was doubly fortunate, and doubtless owed to this its fabled wealth, in that it possessed two activities, namely, pyramid-building as well as the search for the precious metals, the fruits of which, since they could not serve the needs of man by being consumed, did not stale with abundanceThe Middle Ages built cathedrals and sang dirgesTwo pyramids, two masses for the dead, are twice as good as one; but not so two railways from London to York",2
"But again, he doesn't get back to his implied recommendation to engage in public works, even if not fully justified from their direct benefits, when he constructs the theoryOn the contrary he later advises us that .. ..our final task might be to select those variables which can be deliberately controlled or managed by central authority in the kind of system in which we actually live ..and this appears to look forward to a future publication rather than to a subsequent chapter of the General Theory",2
"    Keynesian models and concepts       Aggregate demand    Keynes' view of saving and investment was his most important departure from the classical outlookIt can be illustrated using the ""Keynesian cross"" devised by Paul SamuelsonThe horizontal axis denotes total income and the purple curve shows C (Y ), the propensity to consume, whose complement S (Y ) is the propensity to save: the sum of these two functions is equal to total income, which is shown by the broken line at 45°",2
"The horizontal blue line I (r ) is the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital whose value is independent of YThe schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital is dependent on the interest rate, specifically the interest rate cost of a new investmentIf the interest rate charged by the financial sector to the productive sector is below the marginal efficiency of capital at that level of technology and capital intensity then investment is positive and grows the lower the interest rate is, given the diminishing return of capital",2
"If the interest rate is above the marginal efficiency of capital then investment is equal to zeroKeynes interprets this as the demand for investment and denotes the sum of demands for consumption and investment as ""aggregate demand"", plotted as a separate curveAggregate demand must equal total income, so equilibrium income must be determined by the point where the aggregate demand curve crosses the 45° lineThis is the same horizontal position as the intersection of I (r ) with S (Y )",2
"The equation I (r )   S (Y ) had been accepted by the classics, who had viewed it as the condition of equilibrium between supply and demand for investment funds and as determining the interest rate (see the classical theory of interest)But insofar as they had had a concept of aggregate demand, they had seen the demand for investment as being given by S (Y ), since for them saving was simply the indirect purchase of capital goods, with the result that aggregate demand was equal to total income as an identity rather than as an equilibrium condition",2
"Keynes takes note of this view in Chapter 2, where he finds it present in the early writings of Alfred Marshall but adds that ""the doctrine is never stated to-day in this crude form""The equation I (r )   S (Y ) is accepted by Keynes for some or all of the following reasons:  As a consequence of the principle of effective demand, which asserts that aggregate demand must equal total income (Chapter 3)",2
"As a consequence of the identity of saving with investment (Chapter 6) together with the equilibrium assumption that these quantities are equal to their demandsIn agreement with the substance of the classical theory of the investment funds market, whose conclusion he considers the classics to have misinterpreted through circular reasoning (Chapter 14)    The Keynesian multiplier   Keynes introduces his discussion of the multiplier in Chapter 10 with a reference to Kahn's earlier paper (see below)",2
"He designates Kahn's multiplier the ""employment multiplier"" in distinction to his own ""investment multiplier"" and says that the two are only ""a little different""Kahn's multiplier has consequently been understood by much of the Keynesian literature as playing a major role in Keynes's own theory, an interpretation encouraged by the difficulty of understanding Keynes's presentationKahn's multiplier gives the title (""The multiplier model"") to the account of Keynesian theory in Samuelson's Economics  and is almost as prominent in Alvin Hansen's Guide to Keynes  and in Joan Robinson's Introduction to the Theory of Employment",2
"Keynes states that there is .. ..a confusion between the logical theory of the multiplier, which holds good continuously, without time-lag ..and the consequence of an expansion in the capital goods industries which take gradual effect, subject to a time-lag, and only after an interval ..and implies that he is adopting the former theoryAnd when the multiplier eventually emerges as a component of Keynes's theory (in Chapter 18) it turns out to be simply a measure of the change of one variable in response to a change in another",2
"The schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital is identified as one of the independent variables of the economic system: ""What [it] tells us, is ..the point to which the output of new investment will be pushed ..."" The multiplier then gives ""the ratio ..between an increment of investment and the corresponding increment of aggregate income"".GLSShackle regarded Keynes' move away from Kahn's multiplier as .. ..a retrograde step ..",2
"For when we look upon the Multiplier as an instantaneous functional relation ..we are merely using the word Multiplier to stand for an alternative way of looking at the marginal propensity to consume ..., which GMAmbrosi cites as an instance of ""a Keynesian commentator who would have liked Keynes to have written something less 'retrograde'"".The value Keynes assigns to his multiplier is the reciprocal of the marginal propensity to save: k    1 / S '(Y )",2
"This is the same as the formula for Kahn's mutliplier in a closed economy assuming that all saving (including the purchase of durable goods), and not just hoarding, constitutes leakageKeynes gave his formula almost the status of a definition (it is put forward in advance of any explanation)His multiplier is indeed the value of ""the ratio ..between an increment of investment and the corresponding increment of aggregate income"" as Keynes derived it from his Chapter 13 model of liquidity preference, which implies that income must bear the entire effect of a change in investment",2
But under his Chapter 15 model a change in the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital has an effect shared between the interest rate and income in proportions depending on the partial derivatives of the liquidity preference functionKeynes did not investigate the question of whether his formula for multiplier needed revision    The liquidity trap   The liquidity trap is a phenomenon that may impede the effectiveness of monetary policies in reducing unemployment,2
"Economists generally think the rate of interest will not fall below a certain limit, often seen as zero or a slightly negative numberKeynes suggested that the limit might be appreciably greater than zero but did not attach much practical significance to itThe term ""liquidity trap"" was coined by Dennis Robertson in his comments on the General Theory, but it was John Hicks in ""MrKeynes and the Classics"" who recognised the significance of a slightly different concept",2
"If the economy is in a position such that the liquidity preference curve is almost vertical, as must happen as the lower limit on r  is approached, then a change in the money supply M̂  makes almost no difference to the equilibrium rate of interest r̂  or, unless there is compensating steepness in the other curves, to the resulting income ŶAs Hicks put it, ""Monetary means will not force down the rate of interest any further."" Paul Krugman has worked extensively on the liquidity trap, claiming that it was the problem confronting the Japanese economy around the turn of the millennium",2
"In his later words:  Short-term interest rates were close to zero, long-term rates were at historical lows, yet private investment spending remained insufficient to bring the economy out of deflationIn that environment, monetary policy was just as ineffective as Keynes describedAttempts by the Bank of Japan to increase the money supply simply added to already ample bank reserves and public holdings of cash..     The IS–LM model     Hicks showed how to analyze Keynes' system when liquidity preference is a function of income as well as of the rate of interest",2
"Keynes's admission of income as an influence on the demand for money is a step back in the direction of classical theory, and Hicks takes a further step in the same direction by generalizing the propensity to save to take both Y  and r  as argumentsLess classically he extends this generalization to the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capitalThe IS-LM model uses two equations to express Keynes' modelThe first, now written I (Y, r )   S (Y,r ), expresses the principle of effective demand",2
"We may construct a graph on (Y, r ) coordinates and draw a line connecting those points satisfying the equation: this is the IS  curveIn the same way we can write the equation of equilibrium between liquidity preference and the money supply as L(Y ,r )   M̂ and draw a second curve – the LM  curve – connecting points that satisfy itThe equilibrium values Ŷ  of total income and r̂  of interest rate are then given by the point of intersection of the two curves",2
"If we follow Keynes's initial account under which liquidity preference depends only on the interest rate r, then the LM  curve is horizontalJoan Robinson commented that:  ..modern teaching has been confused by JRHicks' attempt to reduce the General Theory to a version of static equilibrium with the formula IS–LMHicks has now repented and changed his name from JRto John, but it will take a long time for the effects of his teaching to wear off",2
"Hicks subsequently relapsed    Keynesian economic policies       Active fiscal policy    Keynes argued that the solution to the Great Depression was to stimulate the country (""incentive to invest"") through some combination of two approaches:  A reduction in interest rates (monetary policy), and Government investment in infrastructure (fiscal policy).If the interest rate at which businesses and consumers can borrow decreases, investments that were previously uneconomic become profitable, and large consumer sales normally financed through debt (such as houses, automobiles, and, historically, even appliances like refrigerators) become more affordable",2
"A principal function of central banks in countries that have them is to influence this interest rate through a variety of mechanisms collectively called monetary policyThis is how monetary policy that reduces interest rates is thought to stimulate economic activity, i.e., ""grow the economy""—and why it is called expansionary monetary policyExpansionary fiscal policy consists of increasing net public spending, which the government can effect by a) taxing less, b) spending more, or c) both",2
"Investment and consumption by government raises demand for businesses' products and for employment, reversing the effects of the aforementioned imbalanceIf desired spending exceeds revenue, the government finances the difference by borrowing from capital markets by issuing government bondsThis is called deficit spendingTwo points are important to note at this pointFirst, deficits are not required for expansionary fiscal policy, and second, it is only change in net spending that can stimulate or depress the economy",2
"For example, if a government ran a deficit of 10% both last year and this year, this would represent neutral fiscal policyIn fact, if it ran a deficit of 10% last year and 5% this year, this would actually be contractionaryOn the other hand, if the government ran a surplus of 10% of GDP last year and 5% this year, that would be expansionary fiscal policy, despite never running a deficit at all",2
"But – contrary to some critical characterizations of it – Keynesianism does not consist solely of deficit spending, since it recommends adjusting fiscal policies according to cyclical circumstancesAn example of a counter-cyclical policy is raising taxes to cool the economy and to prevent inflation when there is abundant demand-side growth, and engaging in deficit spending on labour-intensive infrastructure projects to stimulate employment and stabilize wages during economic downturnsKeynes's ideas influenced Franklin D",2
"Roosevelt's view that insufficient buying-power caused the DepressionDuring his presidency, Roosevelt adopted some aspects of Keynesian economics, especially after 1937, when, in the depths of the Depression, the United States suffered from recession yet again following fiscal contractionBut to many the true success of Keynesian policy can be seen at the onset of World War II, which provided a kick to the world economy, removed uncertainty, and forced the rebuilding of destroyed capital",2
"Keynesian ideas became almost official in social-democratic Europe after the war and in the U.Sin the 1960sThe Keynesian advocacy of deficit spending contrasted with the classical and neoclassical economic analysis of fiscal policyThey admitted that fiscal stimulus could actuate productionBut, to these schools, there was no reason to believe that this stimulation would outrun the side-effects that ""crowd out"" private investment: first, it would increase the demand for labour and raise wages, hurting profitability; Second, a government deficit increases the stock of government bonds, reducing their market price and encouraging high interest rates, making it more expensive for business to finance fixed investment",2
"Thus, efforts to stimulate the economy would be self-defeatingThe Keynesian response is that such fiscal policy is appropriate only when unemployment is persistently high, above the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)In that case, crowding out is minimalFurther, private investment can be ""crowded in"": Fiscal stimulus raises the market for business output, raising cash flow and profitability, spurring business optimismTo Keynes, this accelerator effect meant that government and business could be complements rather than substitutes in this situation",2
"Second, as the stimulus occurs, gross domestic product rises—raising the amount of saving, helping to finance the increase in fixed investmentFinally, government outlays need not always be wasteful: government investment in public goods that is not provided by profit-seekers encourages the private sector's growthThat is, government spending on such things as basic research, public health, education, and infrastructure could help the long-term growth of potential outputIn Keynes's theory, there must be significant slack in the labour market before fiscal expansion is justified",2
"Keynesian economists believe that adding to profits and incomes during boom cycles through tax cuts, and removing income and profits from the economy through cuts in spending during downturns, tends to exacerbate the negative effects of the business cycleThis effect is especially pronounced when the government controls a large fraction of the economy, as increased tax revenue may aid investment in state enterprises in downturns, and decreased state revenue and investment harm those enterprises",2
"    Views on trade imbalance   In the last few years of his life, John Maynard Keynes was much preoccupied with the question of balance in international tradeHe was the leader of the British delegation to the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in 1944 that established the Bretton Woods system of international currency managementHe was the principal author of a proposal – the so-called Keynes Plan – for an International Clearing Union",2
"The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by 'creating' additional 'international money', and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibriumIn the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because ""American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships"".The new system is not founded on free trade (liberalisation of foreign trade) but rather on regulating international trade to eliminate trade imbalances",2
"Nations with a surplus would have a powerful incentive to get rid of it, which would automatically clear other nations' deficitsKeynes proposed a global bank that would issue its own currency—the bancor—which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplusEvery country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union",2
"He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a ""negative externality"" on trading partners, and posed far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperityKeynes thought that surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalancesIn ""National Self-Sufficiency"" The Yale Review, Vol22, no4 (June 1933), he already highlighted the problems created by free tradeHis view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance",2
"Failure for them to do so could have serious consequencesIn the words of Geoffrey Crowther, then editor of The Economist, ""If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.""These ideas were informed by events prior to the Great Depression when – in the opinion of Keynes and others – international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.Influenced by Keynes, economic texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade",2
"For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the 'problem of balance'However, in more recent years, since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view",2
"They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08    Views on free trade and protectionism        The turning point of the Great Depression    At the beginning of his career, Keynes was an economist close to Alfred Marshall, deeply convinced of the benefits of free tradeFrom the crisis of 1929 onwards, noting the commitment of the British authorities to defend the gold parity of the pound sterling and the rigidity of nominal wages, he gradually adhered to protectionist measures.On 5 November 1929, when heard by the Macmillan Committee to bring the British economy out of the crisis, Keynes indicated that the introduction of tariffs on imports would help to rebalance the trade balance",2
"The committee's report states in a section entitled ""import control and export aid"", that in an economy where there is not full employment, the introduction of tariffs can improve production and employmentThus the reduction of the trade deficit favours the country's growth.In January 1930, in the Economic Advisory Council, Keynes proposed the introduction of a system of protection to reduce importsIn the autumn of 1930, he proposed a uniform tariff of 10% on all imports and subsidies of the same rate for all exports",2
"In the Treatise on Money, published in the autumn of 1930, he took up the idea of tariffs or other trade restrictions with the aim of reducing the volume of imports and rebalancing the balance of trade.On 7 March 1931, in the New Statesman and Nation, he wrote an article entitled Proposal for a Tariff RevenueHe pointed out that the reduction of wages led to a reduction in national demand which constrained markets",2
"Instead, he proposes the idea of an expansionary policy combined with a tariff system to neutralise the effects on the balance of tradeThe application of customs tariffs seemed to him ""unavoidable, whoever the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be"".Thus, for Keynes, an economic recovery policy is only fully effective if the trade deficit is eliminatedHe proposed a 15% tax on manufactured and semi-manufactured goods and 5% on certain foodstuffs and raw materials, with others needed for exports exempted (wool, cotton).In 1932, in an article entitled The Pro- and Anti-Tariffs, published in The Listener, he envisaged the protection of farmers and certain sectors such as the automobile and iron and steel industries, considering them indispensable to Britain",2
"     The critique of the theory of comparative advantage    In the post-crisis situation of 1929, Keynes judged the assumptions of the free trade model unrealisticHe criticised, for example, the neoclassical assumption of wage adjustment.As early as 1930, in a note to the Economic Advisory Council, he doubted the intensity of the gain from specialisation in the case of manufactured goodsWhile participating in the MacMillan Committee, he admitted that he no longer ""believed in a very high degree of national specialisation"" and refused to ""abandon any industry which is unable, for the moment, to survive""",2
"He also criticised the static dimension of the theory of comparative advantage, which, in his view, by fixing comparative advantages definitively, led in practice to a waste of national resources.In the Daily Mail of 13 March 1931, he called the assumption of perfect sectoral labour mobility ""nonsense"" since it states that a person made unemployed contributes to a reduction in the wage rate until he finds a jobBut for Keynes, this change of job may involve costs (job search, training) and is not always possible",2
"Generally speaking, for Keynes, the assumptions of full employment and automatic return to equilibrium discredit the theory of comparative advantage.In July 1933, he published an article in the New Statesman and Nation entitled National Self-Sufficiency, in which he criticised the argument of the specialisation of economies, which is the basis of free tradeHe thus proposed the search for a certain degree of self-sufficiencyInstead of the specialisation of economies advocated by the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage, he prefers the maintenance of a diversity of activities for nations",2
"In it he refutes the principle of peacemaking tradeHis vision of trade became that of a system where foreign capitalists compete for new marketsHe defends the idea of producing on national soil when possible and reasonable and expresses sympathy for the advocates of protectionism He notes in National Self-Sufficiency: A considerable degree of international specialization is necessary in a rational world in all cases where it is dictated by wide differences of climate, natural resources, native aptitudes, level of culture and density of population",2
"But over an increasingly wide range of industrial products, and perhaps of agricultural products also, I have become doubtful whether the economic loss of national self-sufficiency is great enough to outweigh the other advantages of gradually bringing the product and the consumer within the ambit of the same national, economic, and financial organizationExperience accumulates to prove that most modern processes of mass production can be performed in most countries and climates with almost equal efficiency",2
"He also writes in National Self-Sufficiency:I sympathize, therefore, with those who would minimize, rather than with those who would maximize, economic entanglement among nationsIdeas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel—these are the things which should of their nature be internationalBut let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily nationalLater, Keynes had a written correspondence with James Meade centred on the issue of import restrictions",2
"Keynes and Meade discussed the best choice between quota and tariffIn March 1944 Keynes began a discussion with Marcus Fleming after the latter had written an article entitled Quotas versus depreciationOn this occasion, we see that he has definitely taken a protectionist stance after the Great DepressionHe considered that quotas could be more effective than currency depreciation in dealing with external imbalancesThus, for Keynes, currency depreciation was no longer sufficient, and protectionist measures became necessary to avoid trade deficits",2
"To avoid the return of crises due to a self-regulating economic system, it seemed essential to him to regulate trade and stop free trade (deregulation of foreign trade).He points out that countries that import more than they export weaken their economiesWhen the trade deficit increases, unemployment rises and GDP slows downAnd surplus countries exert a ""negative externality"" on their trading partnersThey get richer at the expense of others and destroy the output of their trading partners",2
"John Maynard Keynes believed that the products of surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalancesThus he no longer believes in the theory of comparative advantage (on which free trade is based) which states that the trade deficit does not matter, since trade is mutually beneficialThis also explains his desire to replace the liberalisation of international trade (Free Trade) with a regulatory system aimed at eliminating trade imbalances in his proposals for the Bretton Woods Agreement",2
"    Postwar Keynesianism    Keynes's ideas became widely accepted after World War II, and until the early 1970s, Keynesian economics provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countriesGovernments prepared high quality economic statistics on an ongoing basis and tried to base their policies on the Keynesian theory that had become the normIn the early era of social liberalism and social democracy, most western capitalist countries enjoyed low, stable unemployment and modest inflation, an era called the Golden Age of Capitalism",2
"In terms of policy, the twin tools of post-war Keynesian economics were fiscal policy and monetary policyWhile these are credited to Keynes, others, such as economic historian David Colander, argue that they are, rather, due to the interpretation of Keynes by Abba Lerner in his theory of functional finance, and should instead be called ""Lernerian"" rather than ""Keynesian"".Through the 1950s, moderate degrees of government demand leading industrial development, and use of fiscal and monetary counter-cyclical policies continued, and reached a peak in the ""go go"" 1960s, where it seemed to many Keynesians that prosperity was now permanent",2
" In 1971, Republican US President Richard Nixon even proclaimed ""I am now a Keynesian in economics.""Beginning in the late 1960s, a new classical macroeconomics movement arose, critical of Keynesian assumptions (see sticky prices), and seemed, especially in the 1970s, to explain certain phenomena betterIt was characterized by explicit and rigorous adherence to microfoundations, as well as use of increasingly sophisticated mathematical modellingWith the oil shock of 1973, and the economic problems of the 1970s, Keynesian economics began to fall out of favour",2
"During this time, many economies experienced high and rising unemployment, coupled with high and rising inflation, contradicting the Phillips curve's predictionThis stagflation meant that the simultaneous application of expansionary (anti-recession) and contractionary (anti-inflation) policies appeared necessaryThis dilemma led to the end of the Keynesian near-consensus of the 1960s, and the rise throughout the 1970s of ideas based upon more classical analysis, including monetarism, supply-side economics, and new classical economicsHowever, by the late 1980s, certain failures of the new classical models, both theoretical (see Real business cycle theory) and empirical (see the ""Volcker recession"") hastened the emergence of New Keynesian economics, a school that sought to unite the most realistic aspects of Keynesian and neo-classical assumptions and place them on more rigorous theoretical foundation than ever before",2
"One line of thinking, utilized also as a critique of the notably high unemployment and potentially disappointing GNP growth rates associated with the new classical models by the mid-1980s, was to emphasize low unemployment and maximal economic growth at the cost of somewhat higher inflation (its consequences kept in check by indexing and other methods, and its overall rate kept lower and steadier by such potential policies as Martin Weitzman's share economy)",2
"    Schools   Multiple schools of economic thought that trace their legacy to Keynes currently exist, the notable ones being neo-Keynesian economics, New Keynesian economics, post-Keynesian economics, and the new neoclassical synthesisKeynes's biographer Robert Skidelsky writes that the post-Keynesian school has remained closest to the spirit of Keynes's work in following his monetary theory and rejecting the neutrality of moneyToday these ideas, regardless of provenance, are referred to in academia under the rubric of ""Keynesian economics"", due to Keynes's role in consolidating, elaborating, and popularizing them",2
"In the postwar era, Keynesian analysis was combined with neoclassical economics to produce what is generally termed the ""neoclassical synthesis"", yielding neo-Keynesian economics, which dominated mainstream macroeconomic thoughtThough it was widely held that there was no strong automatic tendency to full employment, many believed that if government policy were used to ensure it, the economy would behave as neoclassical theory predictedThis post-war domination by neo-Keynesian economics was broken during the stagflation of the 1970s",2
"There was a lack of consensus among macroeconomists in the 1980s, and during this period New Keynesian economics was developed, ultimately becoming- along with new classical macroeconomics- a part of the current consensus, known as the new neoclassical synthesis.Post-Keynesian economists, on the other hand, reject the neoclassical synthesis and, in general, neoclassical economics applied to the macroeconomyPost-Keynesian economics is a heterodox school that holds that both neo-Keynesian economics and New Keynesian economics are incorrect, and a misinterpretation of Keynes's ideas",2
"The post-Keynesian school encompasses a variety of perspectives, but has been far less influential than the other more mainstream Keynesian schools.Interpretations of Keynes have emphasized his stress on the international coordination of Keynesian policies, the need for international economic institutions, and the ways in which economic forces could lead to war or could promote peace    Keynesianism and liberalism   In a 2014 paper, economist Alan Blinder argues that, ""for not very good reasons,"" public opinion in the United States has associated Keynesianism with liberalism, and he states that such is incorrect",2
" For example, both Presidents Ronald Reagan (1981–89) and George WBush (2001–09) supported policies that were, in fact, Keynesian, even though both men were conservative leaders And tax cuts can provide highly helpful fiscal stimulus during a recession, just as much as infrastructure spending canBlinder concludes, ""If you are not teaching your students that 'Keynesianism' is neither conservative nor liberal, you should be.""     Other schools of macroeconomic thought   The Keynesian schools of economics are situated alongside a number of other schools that have the same perspectives on what the economic issues are, but differ on what causes them and how best to resolve them",2
"Today, most of these schools of thought have been subsumed into modern macroeconomic theory    Stockholm School    The Stockholm school rose to prominence at about the same time that Keynes published his General Theory and shared a common concern in business cycles and unemploymentThe second generation of Swedish economists also advocated government intervention through spending during economic downturns although opinions are divided over whether they conceived the essence of Keynes's theory before he did",2
"    Monetarism    There was debate between monetarists and Keynesians in the 1960s over the role of government in stabilizing the economyBoth monetarists and Keynesians agree that issues such as business cycles, unemployment, and deflation are caused by inadequate demandHowever, they had fundamentally different perspectives on the capacity of the economy to find its own equilibrium, and the degree of government intervention that would be appropriateKeynesians emphasized the use of discretionary fiscal policy and monetary policy, while monetarists argued the primacy of monetary policy, and that it should be rules-based.The debate was largely resolved in the 1980s",2
"Since then, economists have largely agreed that central banks should bear the primary responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and that monetary policy should largely follow the Taylor rule – which many economists credit with the Great ModerationThe financial crisis of 2007–08, however, has convinced many economists and governments of the need for fiscal interventions and highlighted the difficulty in stimulating economies through monetary policy alone during a liquidity trap    Marxian economics    Some Marxist economists criticized Keynesian economics",2
"For example, in his 1946 appraisal Paul Sweezy—while admitting that there was much in the General Theory's analysis of effective demand that Marxists could draw on—described Keynes as a prisoner of his neoclassical upbringingSweezy argued that Keynes had never been able to view the capitalist system as a totalityHe argued that Keynes regarded the class struggle carelessly, and overlooked the class role of the capitalist state, which he treated as a deus ex machina, and some other points",2
"While Michał Kalecki was generally enthusiastic about the Keynesian revolution, he predicted that it would not endure, in his article ""Political Aspects of Full Employment""In the article Kalecki predicted that the full employment delivered by Keynesian policy would eventually lead to a more assertive working class and weakening of the social position of business leaders, causing the elite to use their political power to force the displacement of the Keynesian policy even though profits would be higher than under a laissez faire system: The erosion of social prestige and political power would be unacceptable to the elites despite higher profits",2
"    Public choice    James MBuchanan criticized Keynesian economics on the grounds that governments would in practice be unlikely to implement theoretically optimal policiesThe implicit assumption underlying the Keynesian fiscal revolution, according to Buchanan, was that economic policy would be made by wise men, acting without regard to political pressures or opportunities, and guided by disinterested economic technocratsHe argued that this was an unrealistic assumption about political, bureaucratic and electoral behaviour",2
"Buchanan blamed Keynesian economics for what he considered a decline in America's fiscal disciplineBuchanan argued that deficit spending would evolve into a permanent disconnect between spending and revenue, precisely because it brings short-term gains, so, ending up institutionalizing irresponsibility in the federal government, the largest and most central institution in our society.Martin Feldstein argues that the legacy of Keynesian economics–the misdiagnosis of unemployment, the fear of saving, and the unjustified government intervention–affected the fundamental ideas of policy makers.Milton Friedman thought that Keynes's political bequest was harmful for two reasons",2
"First, he thought whatever the economic analysis, benevolent dictatorship is likely sooner or later to lead to a totalitarian societySecond, he thought Keynes's economic theories appealed to a group far broader than economists primarily because of their link to his political approach.Alex Tabarrok argues that Keynesian politics–as distinct from Keynesian policies–has failed pretty much whenever it's been tried, at least in liberal democracies.In response to this argument, John Quiggin, wrote about these theories' implication for a liberal democratic order",2
"He thought that if it is generally accepted that democratic politics is nothing more than a battleground for competing interest groups, then reality will come to resemble the modelPaul Krugman wrote ""I don’t think we need to take that as an immutable fact of life; but still, what are the alternatives?"" Daniel Kuehn, criticized James MBuchananHe argued, ""if you have a problem with politicians – criticize politicians,"" not Keynes",2
"He also argued that empirical evidence makes it pretty clear that Buchanan was wrong.James Tobin argued, if advising government officials, politicians, voters, it's not for economists to play games with themKeynes implicitly rejected this argument, in ""soon or late it is ideas not vested interests which are dangerous for good or evil.""Brad DeLong has argued that politics is the main motivator behind objections to the view that government should try to serve a stabilizing macroeconomic role",2
"Paul Krugman argued that a regime that by and large lets markets work, but in which the government is ready both to rein in excesses and fight slumps is inherently unstable, due to intellectual instability, political instability, and financial instability    New classical    Another influential school of thought was based on the Lucas critique of Keynesian economicsThis called for greater consistency with microeconomic theory based on rational choice theory, and in particular emphasized the idea of rational expectations",2
"Lucas and others argued that Keynesian economics required remarkably foolish and short-sighted behaviour from people, which totally contradicted the economic understanding of their behaviour at a micro level New classical economics introduced a set of macroeconomic theories that were based on optimizing microeconomic behaviourThese models have been developed into the real business-cycle theory, which argues that business cycle fluctuations can to a large extent be accounted for by real (in contrast to nominal) shocks",2
"Beginning in the late 1950s new classical macroeconomists began to disagree with the methodology employed by Keynes and his successors Keynesians emphasized the dependence of consumption on disposable income and, also, of investment on current profits and current cash flowIn addition, Keynesians posited a Phillips curve that tied nominal wage inflation to unemployment rate To support these theories, Keynesians typically traced the logical foundations of their model (using introspection) and supported their assumptions with statistical evidence",2
"New classical theorists demanded that macroeconomics be grounded on the same foundations as microeconomic theory, profit-maximizing firms and rational, utility-maximizing consumers.The result of this shift in methodology produced several important divergences from Keynesian macroeconomics: Independence of consumption and current income (life-cycle permanent income hypothesis) Irrelevance of current profits to investment (Modigliani–Miller theorem) Long run independence of inflation and unemployment (natural rate of unemployment) The inability of monetary policy to stabilize output (rational expectations) Irrelevance of taxes and budget deficits to consumption (Ricardian equivalence)     See also       References       Further reading       External links   Works by John Maynard Keynes at Project Gutenberg ""We are all Keynesians now"" – Historic article from Time magazine, 1965",2
"Labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labourLabour is a commodity that is supplied by labourers in exchange for a wage paid by demanding firmsBecause these labourers exist as parts of a social, institutional, or political system, labour economics is often regarded as a sociology or political science.Labour markets or job markets function through the interaction of workers and employersLabour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services (workers) and the demanders of labour services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income",2
"These patterns exist because each individual in the market is presumed to make rational choices based on the information that they know regarding wage, desire to provide labour, and desire for leisureLabour markets are normally geographically bounded, but the rise of the internet has brought about a 'planetary labour market' in some sectors.Labour is a measure of the work done by human beingsIt is conventionally contrasted with other factors of production, such as land and capital",2
"Some theories focus on human capital, or entrepreneurship, (which refers to the skills that workers possess and not necessarily the actual work that they produce)Labour is unique to study because it is a special type of good that cannot be separated from the owner (i.ethe work cannot be separated from the person who does it)A labour market is also different from other markets in that workers are the suppliers and firms are the demanders",2
"    Macro and micro analysis of labour markets   There are two sides to labour economicsLabour economics can generally be seen as the application of microeconomic or macroeconomic techniques to the labour marketMicroeconomic techniques study the role of individuals and individual firms in the labour marketMacroeconomic techniques look at the interrelations between the labour market, the goods market, the money market, and the foreign trade marketIt looks at how these interactions influence macro variables such as employment levels, participation rates, aggregate income and gross domestic product",2
"    Macroeconomics of labour markets    The labour market in macroeconomic theory shows that the supply of labour exceeds demand, which has been proven by salary growth that lags productivity growthWhen labour supply exceeds demand, salary faces downward pressure due to an employer's ability to pick from a labour pool that exceeds the jobs poolHowever, if the demand for labour is larger than the supply, salary increases, as employee have more bargaining power while employers have to compete for scarce labour.The Labour force (LF) is defined as the number of people of working age, who are either employed or actively looking for work (unemployed)",2
"The labour force participation rate (LFPR) is the number of people in the labour force divided by the size of the adult civilian noninstitutional population (or by the population of working age that is not institutionalized), LFPR   LF/Population.The non-labour force includes those who are not looking for work, those who are institutionalized (such as in prisons or psychiatric wards), stay-at-home spouses, children not of working age, and those serving in the military",2
"The unemployment level is defined as the labour force minus the number of people currently employedThe unemployment rate is defined as the level of unemployment divided by the labour forceThe employment rate is defined as the number of people currently employed divided by the adult population (or by the population of working age) In these statistics, self-employed people are counted as employed.The skills required in a labour force can vary from individual to individual, as well as from firm to firm",2
"Some firms have specific skills they are interested in, limiting the labour force to certain criteriaA firm requiring specific skills will help determine the size of the market.Variables like employment level, unemployment level, labour force, and unfilled vacancies are called stock variables because they measure a quantity at a point in timeThey can be contrasted with flow variables which measure a quantity over a duration of timeChanges in the labour force are due to flow variables such as natural population growth, net immigration, new entrants, and retirements",2
" Changes in unemployment depend on inflows (non-employed people starting to look for jobs and employed people who lose their jobs that are looking for new ones) and outflows (people who find new employment and people who stop looking for employment)When looking at the overall macroeconomy, several types of unemployment have been identified, which can be separated into two categories of natural and unnatural unemployment.Natural Unemployment  Frictional unemployment – This reflects the fact that it takes time for people to find and settle into new jobs that they feel are appropriate for them and their skill set",2
"Technological advancement often reduces frictional unemployment; for example, internet search engines have reduced the cost and time associated with locating employment or personnel selectionStructural unemployment – the number of jobs available in an industry are not sufficient enough to provide jobs to all persons who are interested in working or qualified to work in that industryThis can be due to the changes in industries prevalent in a country or because wages for the industry are too high, causing people to want to supply their labour to that industry",2
"Natural rate of unemployment (also known as full employment) – This is the summation of frictional and structural unemployment, that excludes cyclical contributions of unemployment (e.grecessions) and seasonal unemploymentIt is the lowest rate of unemployment that a stable economy can expect to achieve, given that some frictional and structural unemployment is inevitableEconomists do not agree on the level of the natural rate, with estimates ranging from 1% to 5%, or on its meaning – some associate it with ""non-accelerating inflation""",2
" The estimated rate varies between countries and across time.Unnatural Unemployment  Demand deficient unemployment (also known as cyclical unemployment) – In Keynesian economics, any level of unemployment beyond the natural rate is probably due to insufficient goods demand in the overall economyDuring a recession, aggregate expenditure is deficient causing the underutilisation of inputs (including labour)Aggregate expenditure (AE) can be increased, according to Keynes, by increasing consumption spending (C), increasing investment spending (I), increasing government spending (G), or increasing the net of exports minus imports (X−M), since AE   C + I + G + (X−M)",2
"Seasonal unemployment -- unemployment due to seasonal fluctuations of demand for workers across industries, such as in the retail industry after holidays that involve a lot of shopping are over    Neoclassical microeconomics of labour markets   Neoclassical economists view the labour market as similar to other markets in that the forces of supply and demand jointly determine the price (in this case the wage rate) and quantity (in this case the number of people employed)",2
"However, the labour market differs from other markets (like the markets for goods or the financial market) in several waysIn particular, the labour market may act as a non-clearing marketWhile according to neoclassical theory most markets quickly attain a point of equilibrium without excess supply or demand, this may not be true of the labour market: it may have a persistent level of unemploymentContrasting the labour market to other markets also reveals persistent compensating differentials among similar workers",2
"Models that assume perfect competition in the labour market, as discussed below, conclude that workers earn their marginal product of labour    Neoclassical microeconomic model – Supply    Households are suppliers of labourIn microeconomic theory, people are assumed to be rational and seeking to maximize their utility functionIn the labour market model, their utility function expresses trade-offs in preference between leisure time and income from time used for labourHowever, they are constrained by the hours available to them",2
"Let w denote the hourly wage, k denote total hours available for labour and leisure, L denote the chosen number of working hours,  π denote income from non-labour sources, and A denote leisure hours chosenThe individual's problem is to maximise utility U, which depends on total income available for spending on consumption and also depends on the time spent in leisure, subject to a time constraint, with respect to the choices of labour time and leisure time:                                    maximize                           U         (         w         L         +         π         ,         A         )                             subject to                           L         +         A         ≤         k         ",2
"                {\displaystyle {\text{maximize}}\quad U(wL+\pi ,A)\quad {\text{subject to}}\quad L+A\leq k.}   This is shown in the graph below, which illustrates the trade-off between allocating time to leisure activities and allocating it to income-generating activitiesThe linear constraint indicates that every additional hour of leisure undertaken requires the loss of an hour of labour and thus of the fixed amount of goods that that labour's income could purchaseIndividuals must choose how much time to allocate to leisure activities and how much to working",2
"This allocation decision is informed by the indifference curve labelled IC1The curve indicates the combinations of leisure and work that will give the individual a specific level of utilityThe point where the highest indifference curve is just tangent to the constraint line (point A), illustrates the optimum for this supplier of labour servicesIf consumption is measured by the value of income obtained, this diagram can be used to show a variety of interesting effects",2
"This is because the absolute value of the slope of the budget constraint is the wage rateThe point of optimisation (point A) reflects the equivalency between the wage rate and the marginal rate of substitution of leisure for income (the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve)Because the marginal rate of substitution of leisure for income is also the ratio of the marginal utility of leisure (MUL) to the marginal utility of income (MUY), one can conclude:                                                                M                                U                                    L                                                                         M                                U                                    Y                                                                                                                           d               Y                                         d               L                                          ,                 {\displaystyle {{MU^{L}} \over {MU^{Y}}} {{dY} \over {dL}},}   where Y is total income and the right side is the wage rate",2
" If the wage rate increases, this individual's constraint line pivots up from X,Y1 to X,Y2He/she can now purchase more goods and servicesHis/her utility will increase from point A on IC1 to point B on IC2To understand what effect this might have on the decision of how many hours to work, one must look at the income effect and substitution effectThe wage increase shown in the previous diagram can be decomposed into two separate effects",2
"The pure income effect is shown as the movement from point A to point C in the next diagramConsumption increases from YA to YC and – since the diagram assumes that leisure is a normal good – leisure time increases from XA to XC(Employment time decreases by the same amount as leisure increases.)  But that is only part of the pictureAs the wage rate rises, the worker will substitute away from leisure and into the provision of labour—that is, will work more hours to take advantage of the higher wage rate, or in other words substitute away from leisure because of its higher opportunity cost",2
"This substitution effect is represented by the shift from point C to point BThe net impact of these two effects is shown by the shift from point A to point BThe relative magnitude of the two effects depends on the circumstancesIn some cases, such as the one shown, the substitution effect is greater than the income effect (in which case more time will be allocated to working), but in other cases, the income effect will be greater than the substitution effect (in which case less time is allocated to working)",2
"The intuition behind this latter case is that the individual decides that the higher earnings on the previous amount of labour can be ""spent"" by purchasing more leisure If the substitution effect is greater than the income effect, an individual's supply of labour services will increase as the wage rate rises, which is represented by a positive slope in the labour supply curve (as at point E in the adjacent diagram, which exhibits a positive wage elasticity)",2
"This positive relationship is increasing until point F, beyond which the income effect dominates the substitution effect and the individual starts to reduce the number of labour hours he supplies (point G) as wage increases; in other words, the wage elasticity is now negativeThe direction of the slope may change more than once for some individuals, and the labour supply curve is different for different individualsOther variables that affect the labour supply decision, and can be readily incorporated into the model, include taxation, welfare, work environment, and income as a signal of ability or social contribution",2
"    Neoclassical microeconomic model – Demand    A firm's labour demand is based on its marginal physical product of labour (MPPL)This is defined as the additional output (or physical product) that results from an increase of one unit of labour (or from an infinitesimal increase in labour)(See also Production theory basics.) Labour demand is a derived demand; that is, hiring labour is not desired for its own sake but rather because it aids in producing output, which contributes to an employer's revenue and hence profits",2
"The demand for an additional amount of labour depends on the Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) and the marginal cost (MC) of the workerWith a perfectly competitive goods market, the MRP is calculated by multiplying the price of the end product or service by the Marginal Physical Product of the workerIf the MRP is greater than a firm's Marginal Cost, then the firm will employ the worker since doing so will increase profit",2
"The firm only employs however up to the point where MRP MC, and not beyond, in neoclassical economic theory.The MRP of the worker is affected by other inputs to production with which the worker can work (e.gmachinery), often aggregated under the term ""capital""It is typical in economic models for greater availability of capital for a firm to increase the MRP of the worker, all else equalEducation and training are counted as ""human capital""",2
"Since the amount of physical capital affects MRP, and since financial capital flows can affect the amount of physical capital available, MRP and thus wages can be affected by financial capital flows within and between countries, and the degree of capital mobility within and between countries.According to neoclassical theory, over the relevant range of outputs, the marginal physical product of labour is declining (law of diminishing returns)That is, as more and more units of labour are employed, their additional output begins to decline",2
"Additionally, although the MRP is a good way of expressing an employer's demand, other factors such as social group formation can the demand, as well as the labour supplyThis constantly restructures exactly what a labour market is, and leads way to cause problems for theories of inflation    Neoclassical microeconomic model – Equilibrium    The marginal revenue product of labour can be used as the demand for labour curve for this firm in the short run",2
"In competitive markets, a firm faces a perfectly elastic supply of labour which corresponds with the wage rate and the marginal resource cost of labour (W   SL   MFCL)In imperfect markets, the diagram would have to be adjusted because MFCL would then be equal to the wage rate divided by marginal costsBecause optimum resource allocation requires that marginal factor costs equal marginal revenue product, this firm would demand L units of labour as shown in the diagram",2
"The demand for labour of this firm can be summed with the demand for labour of all other firms in the economy to obtain the aggregate demand for labourLikewise, the supply curves of all the individual workers (mentioned above) can be summed to obtain the aggregate supply of labourThese supply and demand curves can be analysed in the same way as any other industry demand and supply curves to determine equilibrium wage and employment levels",2
"Wage differences exist, particularly in mixed and fully/partly flexible labour marketsFor example, the wages of a doctor and a port cleaner, both employed by the NHS, differ greatlyThere are various factors concerning this phenomenonThis includes the MRP of the workerA doctor's MRP is far greater than that of the port cleanerIn addition, the barriers to becoming a doctor are far greater than that of becoming a port cleaner",2
"To become a doctor takes a lot of education and training which is costly, and only those who excel in academia can succeed in becoming doctorsThe port cleaner, however, requires relatively less trainingThe supply of doctors is therefore significantly less elastic than that of port cleanersDemand is also inelastic as there is a high demand for doctors and medical care is a necessity, so the NHS will pay higher wage rates to attract the profession",2
"    Monopsony    Some labour markets have a single employer and thus do not satisfy the perfect competition assumption of the neoclassical model aboveThe model of a monopsonistic labour market gives a lower quantity of employment and a lower equilibrium wage rate than does the competitive model    Asymmetric information    In many real-life situations, the assumption of perfect information is unrealisticAn employer does not necessarily know how hard workers are working or how productive they are",2
"This provides an incentive for workers to shirk from providing their full effort, called moral hazardSince it is difficult for the employer to identify the hard-working and the shirking employees, there is no incentive to work hard and productivity falls overall, leading to the hiring of more workers and a lower unemployment rateOne solution that is used to avoid a moral hazard is stock options that grant employees the chance to benefit directly from a firm's success",2
"However, this solution has attracted criticism as executives with large stock-option packages have been suspected of acting to over-inflate share values to the detriment of the long-run welfare of the firmAnother solution, foreshadowed by the rise of temporary workers in Japan and the firing of many of these workers in response to the financial crisis of 2008, is more flexible job- contracts and -terms that encourage employees to work less than full-time by partially compensating for the loss of hours, relying on workers to adapt their working time in response to job requirements and economic conditions instead of the employer trying to determine how much work is needed to complete a given task and overestimating.Another aspect of uncertainty results from the firm's imperfect knowledge about worker ability",2
"If a firm is unsure about a worker's ability, it pays a wage assuming that the worker's ability is the average of similar workersThis wage under compensates high-ability workers which may drive them away from the labour market as well as at the same time attracting low-ability workersSuch a phenomenon, called adverse selection, can sometimes lead to market collapse.One way to combat adverse selection, firms will try to use signalling, pioneered by Michael Spence, whereby employers could use various characteristics of applicants differentiate between high-ability or low-ability workers",2
"One common signal used is education, whereby employers assume that high-ability workers will have higher levels of educationEmployers can then compensate high-ability workers with higher wagesHowever, signalling does not always work, and it may appear to an external observer that education has raised the marginal product of labour, without this necessarily being true    Search models    One of the major research achievements of the 1990-2010 period was the development of a framework with dynamic search, matching, and bargaining",2
"    Personnel economics: hiring and incentives   At the micro level, one sub-discipline eliciting increased attention in recent decades is analysis of internal labour markets, that is, within firms (or other organisations), studied in personnel economics from the perspective of personnel managementBy contrast, external labour markets ""imply that workers move somewhat fluidly between firms and wages are determined by some aggregate process where firms do not have significant discretion over wage setting."" The focus is on ""how firms establish, maintain, and end employment relationships and on how firms provide incentives to employees,"" including models and empirical work on incentive systems and as constrained by economic efficiency and risk/incentive tradeoffs relating to personnel compensation",2
"    Discrimination and inequality   Inequality and discrimination in the workplace can have many effects on workersIn the context of labour economics, inequality is usually referring to the unequal distribution of earning between householdsInequality is commonly measured by economists using the Gini coefficientThis coefficient does not have a concrete meaning but is more used as a way to compare inequality across regionsThe higher the Gini coefficient is calculated to be the larger inequality exists in a region",2
"Over time, inequality has, on average, been increasingThis is due to numerous factors including labour supply and demand shifts as well as institutional changes in the labour marketOn the shifts in labour supply and demand, factors include demand for skilled workers going up more than the supply of skilled workers and relative to unskilled workers as well as technological changes that increase productivity; all of these things cause wages to go up for skilled labour while unskilled worker wages stay the same or decline",2
"As for the institutional changes, a decrease in union power and a declining real minimum wage, which both reduce unskilled workers wages, and tax cuts for the wealthy all increase the inequality gap between groups of earnersAs for discrimination, it is the difference in pay that can be attributed to the demographic differences between people, such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc, even though these factors do not affect the productivity of the worker",2
"Many regions and countries have enacted government policies to combat discrimination, including discrimination in the workplaceDiscrimination can be modelled and measured in numerous ways The oaxaca decomposition is a common method used to calculate the amount of discrimination that exists when wages differ between groups of peopleThis decomposition aims to calculate the difference in wages that occurs because of differences in skills versus the returns to those skillsA way of modelling discrimination in the workplace when dealing with wages are Gary Becker's taste models",2
"Using taste models, employer discrimination can be thought of as the employer not hiring the minority worker because of their perceived cost of hiring that worker is higher than that of the cost of hiring a non-minority worker, which causes less hiring of the minorityAnother taste model is for employee discrimination, which does not cause a decline in the hiring of minorities, but instead causes a more segregated workforce because the prejudiced worker feels that they should be paid more to work next to the worker they are prejudiced against or that they are not paid an equal amount as the worker they are prejudiced against",2
"One more taste model involves customer discrimination, whereby the employers themselves are not prejudiced but believe that their customers might be, so therefore the employer is less likely to hire the minority worker if they are going to interact with customers that are prejudicedThere are many other taste models other than these that Gary Becker has made to explain discrimination that causes differences in hiring in wages in the labour market",2
"    Criticisms   Many sociologists, political economists, and heterodox economists claim that labour economics tends to lose sight of the complexity of individual employment decisionsThese decisions, particularly on the supply side, are often loaded with considerable emotional baggage and a purely numerical analysis can miss important dimensions of the process, such as social benefits of a high income or wage rate regardless of the marginal utility from increased consumption or specific economic goals",2
"From the perspective of mainstream economics, neoclassical models are not meant to serve as a full description of the psychological and subjective factors that go into a given individual's employment relations, but as a useful approximation of human behaviour in the aggregate, which can be fleshed out further by the use of concepts such as information asymmetry, transaction costs, contract theory etcAlso missing from most labour market analyses is the role of unpaid labour such as unpaid internships where workers with little or no experience are allowed to work a job without pay so that they can gain experience in a particular profession",2
"Even though this type of labour is unpaid it can nevertheless play an important part in society if not abused by employersThe most dramatic example is child raisingHowever, over the past 25 years an increasing literature, usually designated as the economics of the family, has sought to study within household decision making, including joint labour supply, fertility, child-raising, as well as other areas of what is generally referred to as home production",2
"    Wage slavery    The labour market, as institutionalised under today's market economic systems, has been criticised, especially by both mainstream socialists and anarcho-syndicalists, who utilise the term wage slavery as a pejorative for wage labourSocialists draw parallels between the trade of labour as a commodity and slaveryCicero is also known to have suggested such parallels.According to Noam Chomsky, analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the Enlightenment era",2
"In his 1791 book On the Limits of State Action, classical liberal thinker Wilhelm von Humboldt explained how ""whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness"" and so when the labourer works under external control, ""we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is."" Both the Milgram and Stanford experiments have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.The American philosopher John Dewey posited that until ""industrial feudalism"" is replaced by ""industrial democracy,"" politics will be ""the shadow cast on society by big business""",2
"Thomas Ferguson has postulated in his investment theory of party competition that the undemocratic nature of economic institutions under capitalism causes elections to become occasions when blocs of investors coalesce and compete to control the state.As per anthropologist David Graeber, the earliest wage labour contracts we know about were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of the money, and the slave, another, with which to maintain his or her living expenses.) Such arrangements, according to Graeber, were quite common in New World slavery as well, whether in the United States or Brazil",2
"CLRJames argued that most of the techniques of human organisation employed on factory workers during the industrial revolution were first developed on slave plantations.Additionally, Marxists posit that labour-as-commodity, which is how they regard wage labour, provides an absolutely fundamental point of attack against capitalism""It can be persuasively argued,"" noted one concerned philosopher, ""that the conception of the worker's labour as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatisation of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it.""

"The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE or the LSE) is a public research university located in London, England, and a constituent college of the federal University of LondonFounded in 1895 by Fabian Society members Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas, and George Bernard Shaw, LSE joined the University of London in 1900 and established its first degree courses under the auspices of the university in 1901LSE began awarding its degrees in its own name in 2008, prior to which it awarded degrees of the University of London",2
"LSE is located in the London Borough of Camden and Westminster, Central London, near the boundary between Covent Garden and HolbornThe area is historically known as Clare MarketLSE has more than 11,000 students, just under seventy percent of whom come from outside the UK, and 3,300 staffIt had an income of £391.1 million in 2020/21, of which £32.8 million was from research grantsOne hundred and fifty-five nationalities are represented amongst the LSE's student body and the school had the second highest percentage of international students (70%) of the 800 institutions in the 2015–16 Times Higher Education World University Ranking",2
"Despite its name, the school is organised into 25 academic departments and institutes which conduct teaching and research across a range of pure and applied social sciences.LSE is a member of the Russell Group, Association of Commonwealth Universities, European University Association and is often considered a part of the ""Golden Triangle"" of  universities in South East EnglandThe LSE also forms part of CIVICA - The European University of Social Sciences, a network of eight European universities focused on research in the social sciences",2
"In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, the school had the highest proportion of world-leading research among research submitted of any British non-specialist university.LSE Alumni and faculty include 55 past or present heads of state or government and 18 Nobel laureatesAs of 2017, 27% (or 13 out of 49) of all Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economics have been awarded or jointly awarded to LSE alumni, current staff, or former staff, who consequently comprise 16% (13 out of 79) of all Nobel Memorial Prize laureates",2
"LSE alumni and faculty have also won 3 Nobel Peace Prizes and 2 Nobel Prizes in LiteratureOut of all European universities, LSE has educated the most billionaires (11) according to a 2014 global census of US dollar billionaires    History       Origins   The London School of Economics was founded in 1895 by Beatrice and Sidney Webb, initially funded by a bequest of £20,000 from the estate of Henry Hunt HutchinsonHutchinson, a lawyer and member of the Fabian Society, left the money in trust, to be put ""towards advancing its [The Fabian Society's] objects in any way they [the trustees] deem advisable""",2
"The five trustees were Sidney Webb, Edward Pease, Constance Hutchinson, WSde Mattos and William Clark.LSE records that the proposal to establish the school was conceived during a breakfast meeting on 4 August 1894, between the Webbs, Louis Flood and George Bernard ShawThe proposal was accepted by the trustees in February 1895 and LSE held its first classes in October of that year, in rooms at 9 John Street, Adelphi, in the City of Westminster",2
"    20th century   The school joined the federal University of London in 1900, and was recognised as a Faculty of Economics of the universityThe University of London degrees of BSc (Econ) and DSc (Econ) were established in 1901, the first university degrees dedicated to the social sciencesExpanding rapidly over the following years, the school moved initially to the nearby 10 Adelphi Terrace, then to Clare Market and Houghton StreetThe foundation stone of the Old Building, on Houghton Street, was laid by King George V in 1920; the building was opened in 1922",2
" The 1930s economic debate between LSE and Cambridge is well known in academic circlesRivalry between academic opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's Edwin Cannan (1861–1935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, Alfred Marshall (1842–1924), the leading economist of the day, argued about the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole(Marshall disapproved of LSE's separate listing of pure theory and its insistence on economic history.)The dispute also concerned the question of the economist's role, and whether this should be as a detached expert or a practical adviser",2
"Despite the traditional view that the LSE and Cambridge were fierce rivals through the 1920s and 30s, they worked together in the 1920s on the London and Cambridge Economic ServiceHowever, the 1930s brought a return to disputes as economists at the two universities argued over how best to address the economic problems caused by the Great Depression.The main figures in this debate were John Maynard Keynes from Cambridge and the LSE's Friedrich Hayek",2
"The LSE Economist Lionel Robbins was also heavily involvedStarting off as a disagreement over whether demand management or deflation was the better solution to the economic problems of the time, it eventually embraced much wider concepts of economics and macroeconomicsKeynes put forward the theories now known as Keynesian economics, involving the active participation of the state and public sector, while Hayek and Robbins followed the Austrian School, which emphasised free trade and opposed state involvement.During World War II, the school decamped from London to the University of Cambridge, occupying buildings belonging to Peterhouse.The school's arms, including its motto and beaver mascot, were adopted in February 1922, on the recommendation of a committee of twelve, including eight students, which was established to research the matter",2
"The Latin motto, rerum cognoscere causas, is taken from Virgil's GeorgicsIts English translation is ""to Know the Causes of Things"" and it was suggested by Professor Edwin CannanThe beaver mascot was selected for its associations with ""foresight, constructiveness and industrious behaviour""    21st century    LSE continues to have a wide impact within British society, through its relationships and influence in politics, business and lawThe Guardian described such influence in 2005 when it stated:  Once again the political clout of the school, which seems to be closely wired into parliament, Whitehall and the Bank of England, is being felt by ministers...",2
"The strength of LSE is that it is close to the political process: Mervyn King, was a former LSE professorThe former chairman of the House of Commons education committee, Barry Sheerman, sits on its board of governors, along with Labour peer Lord (Frank) JuddAlso on the board are Tory MPs Virginia Bottomley and Richard Shepherd, as well as Lord Saatchi and Lady HoweCommenting in 2001 on the rising status of the LSE, the British magazine The Economist stated that ""two decades ago the LSE was still the poor relation of the University of London's other colleges",2
"Now..it regularly follows Oxford and Cambridge in league tables of research output and teaching quality and is at least as well-known abroad as Oxbridge""According to the magazine, the school ""owes its success to the single-minded, American-style exploitation of its brand name and political connections by the recent directors, particularly Mr Giddens and his predecessor, John Ashworth"" and raises money from foreign students' high fees, which are attracted by academic stars such as Richard Sennett.As of 2006, the school was active in opposing British government proposals to introduce compulsory ID cards, researching into the associated costs of the scheme, and shifting public and government opinion on the issue",2
"The institution is also popular with politicians and MPs to launch new policy, legislation and manifesto pledges, prominently with the launch of the Liberal Democrats Manifesto Conference under Nick Clegg on 12 January 2008     2010 to present     In the early 2010s, its academics have been at the forefront of both national and international government consultations, reviews and policy, including representation on the UK Airports Commission, Independent Police Commission, Migration Advisory Committee, UN Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation, London Finance Commission, HS2 Limited, the UK government's Infrastructure Commission and advising on Architecture and Urbanism for the London 2012 OlympicsCraig Calhoun took up the post of director in September 2012",2
"Its previous director, Judith Rees, is also chair of the school's Grantham Institute on Climate Change, an adviser to the World Bank as well as sitting on the UN Secretary General's advisory board on water and sanitation and the International Scientific Advisory Council (ISAC)She is also a former convenor of the department of geography and environment and served as deputy director from 1998 to 2004In February 2016, Calhoun announced his intention to step down at the end of the academic year, in order to become president of the Berggruen Institute",2
"In September 2016, Bank of England Deputy Governor Dame Nemat (Minouche) Shafik was announced to replace Professor Julia Black as the school's directorShafik began to lead the LSE in September 2017    Controversies    In February 2011, LSE had to face the consequences of matriculating one of Muammar Gaddafi's sons while accepting a £1.5m donation to the university from his familyLSE director Howard Davies resigned over allegations about the institution's links to the Libyan regime",2
"The LSE announced in a statement that it had accepted his resignation with ""great regret"" and that it had set up an external inquiry into the school's relationship with the Libyan regime and Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, to be conducted by the former lord chief justice Harry Woolf.In 2013, the LSE was featured in a BBC Panorama documentary on North Korea, filmed inside the repressive regime by undercover journalists attached to a trip by the LSE's Grimshaw Club, a student society of the international relations department",2
"The trip had been sanctioned by high-level North Korean officialsThe trip caused international media attention as a BBC journalist was posing as a part of LSEThere was debate as to whether this put the student's lives in jeopardy in the repressive regime if a reporter had been exposedThe North Korea government made hostile threats towards the students and LSE after the publicity, which forced an apology from the BBC.In August 2015, it was revealed that the university was paid approximately £40,000 for a ""glowing report"" for Camila Batmanghelidjh's charity, Kids Company",2
"The study was used by Batmanghelidjh to prove that the charity provided good value for money and was well managedThe university did not disclose that the study was funded by the charityIn the summer of 2017, dozens of campus cleaners contracted via Noonan Services went on weekly strikes, protesting outside key buildings and causing significant disruption during end-of-year examinationsThe dispute organised by the UVW union was originally over unfair dismissals of cleaners, but had escalated into a broad demand for decent employment rights matching those of LSE's in-house employees",2
"Owen Jones did not cross the picket line after arriving for a debate on grammar schools with Peter HitchensIt was announced in June 2018 that some 200 outsourced workers at the LSE would be offered in-house contracts     The World Turned Upside Down     A sculpture by Mark Wallinger, The World Turned Upside Down, which features a globe resting on its north pole, was installed in Sheffield Street on the LSE campus on 26 March 2019",2
"The artwork attracted controversy for showing the island of Taiwan as a sovereign entity rather than as part of Greater China, Lhasa being denoted as a full capital, and depicting boundaries between India and China as recognised internationallyThe sculpture also failed to recognise the State of Palestine as a separate country from IsraelAfter protests and reactions from both sides, the school made the decision to alter the work of art over the objections of the Taiwanese students",2
"The university decided later that year that it would retain the original design which chromatically displayed the PRC and Taiwan as different entities consistent with the status quo, but with the addition of an asterisk beside the name of Taiwan and a corresponding placard that clarified the institution's position regarding the controversy    Campus and estate    Since 1902, LSE has been based at Clare Market and Houghton Street in WestminsterIt is surrounded by a number of important institutions including the Royal Courts of Justice, all four Inns of Courts, Royal College of Surgeons, Sir John Soane's Museum, and the West End is immediately across Kingsway from campus, which also borders the City of London and is within walking distance to Trafalgar Square and the Houses of Parliament",2
" In 1920, King George V laid the foundation of the Old BuildingThe campus now occupies an almost continuous group of around 30 buildings between Kingsway and the AldwychAlongside teaching and academic space, the institution also owns 11 student halls of residence across London, a West End theatre (the Peacock), early years centre, NHS medical centre and extensive sports ground in Berrylands, south LondonLSE operates the George IV public house and the students' union operates the Three Tuns bar",2
"The school's campus is noted for its numerous public art installations which include Richard Wilson's Square the Block, Michael Brown's Blue Rain, Christopher Le Brun's Desert Window.Since the early 2000s, the entire campus has undergone an extensive refurbishment project and a major fund-raising ""Campaign for LSE"" raised over £100 million in what was one of the largest university fund-raising exercises outside North America This process was begun with the £35 million renovation of the Lionel Robbins Building by Sir Norman Foster to house the British Library of Political and Economic Science (BLPES), the world's largest social science library and the second largest single entity library in Britain, after the British Library at King's Cross",2
" In 2003, LSE purchased the former Public Trustee building at 24 Kingsway, and engaged Sir Nicholas Grimshaw to redesign it into an ultra-modern educational facility at a total cost of over £45 million – increasing the size of the campus by 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2)The New Academic Building opened for teaching in October 2008, with an official opening by Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on 5 November 2008",2
"In November 2009 the school purchased the adjacent Sardinia House to house three academic departments and the nearby Old White Horse public house, before acquiring the freehold of the grade-II listed Land Registry Building at 32 Lincoln's Inn Fields in October 2010, which was reopened in March 2013 by The Princess Royal as the new home for the department of economics, International Growth Centre and its associated economic research centres    Saw Swee Hock Student Centre   The first new building on the site for more than 40 years, the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre opened in January 2014 following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions",2
"The building provides new accommodation for the LSE Students' Union, LSE accommodation office and LSE careers service as well as a bar, events space, gymnasium, rooftop terrace, learning café, dance studio and media centreThe building, designed as a showpiece for the City of Westminster and Midtown, was recognised as having a low environmental impact, receiving an 'Outstanding' status under BREEAM, and in 2012 was one of three winners of the New London Award in the Education category",2
"In May 2014 the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre won the RIBA London Building of the Year Award    Centre Building   The new Centre Building, situated opposite the British Library of Political and Economic Science, opened in June 2019Designed as both a teaching and an academic space, the new 13-storey Centre Building includes 14 seminar rooms seating between 20 and 60, 234 study spaces, a 200-seater auditorium, as well as three lecture theatres",2
"The building hosts the Department of Government on Levels 3 and 4, the International Inequalities Institute on Levels 4 and 5, and the department of international relations on Levels 7 through 10, and the Directorate on Level 1The roof terraces on levels 2, 6 and 12 are also accessible to the public    Expansion    It is currently embarking on redevelopment and expansion with the development of a £120 million new facility designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners following the completion of a global design competition managed by RIBA Competitions",2
"Completed in 2018, the Global Centre for the Social Sciences houses the Departments of Government, International Relations and the European Institute and feature a new square at the centre of the campus.In September 2013, LSE purchased the freehold of 44 Lincoln's Inn Fields, previously the home of the Francis Crick Institute's laboratories until 2016The building will be demolished in 2017 to make way for the new Paul Marshall Building which will house academic departments (Management, Accounting and Finance), sports facilities and the new Marshall Institute for Philanthropy and Social Entrepreneurship",2
"In 2015, LSE brought its ownership of buildings on Lincoln's Inn Fields to six with the purchase of 5 Lincoln's Inn Fields on the north side of the square, which has since been converted into faculty accommodation.On 15 November 2017, LSE announced that it has achieved contract completion on the purchase to acquire the Nuffield Building, which is adjacent to the Lincoln's Inn Fields, from the Royal College of SurgeonsAccording to the contract the building will be transferred to LSE after renovations in 2020",2
"    Sustainability   As of the 2021–2 academic year, LSE offsets the emissions it measures by funding rainforest treesAccording to the university, it is the first in the UK to do thisThe offset is performed by the Finnish Oy (limited company) Compensate and does not include all emissionsWhile LSE measures and offsets its heating, electricity and faculty plane travel, it does not do this for construction, other travel-related emissions, or food served on campus, for example",2
"The school plans to offset the remaining emissions (scope 1 through 3) by 2050    Organisation and administration       Governance   Although LSE is a constituent college of the federal University of London, it is in many ways comparable with free-standing, self-governing and independently funded universities, and it awards its own degreesLSE is incorporated under the Companies Act as a company limited by guarantee and is an exempt charity within the meaning of Schedule Two of the Charities Act 1993",2
"The principal governance bodies of the LSE are: the LSE Council; the Court of Governors; the academic board; and the director and director's management team.The LSE Council is responsible for strategy and its members are company directors of the schoolIt has specific responsibilities in relation to areas including: the monitoring of institutional performance; finance and financial sustainability; audit arrangements; estate strategy; human resource and employment policy; health and safety; ""educational character and mission"", and student experience",2
"The council is supported in carrying out its role by a number of committees that report directly to it.The Court of Governors deals with certain constitutional matters and has pre-decision discussions on key policy issues and the involvement of individual governors in the school's activitiesThe court has the following formal powers: the appointment of members of court, its subcommittees and of the council; election of the chair and vice chairs of the court and council and honorary fellows of the school; the amendment of the memorandum and articles of association; and the appointment of external auditors.The academic board is LSE's principal academic body, and considers all major issues of general policy affecting the academic life of the school and its development",2
"It is chaired by the director, with staff and student membership, and is supported by its own structure of committeesThe vice chair of the academic board serves as a non-director member of the council and makes a termly report to the council     Director     The director is the head of LSE and its chief executive officer, responsible for executive management and leadership on academic issuesThe director reports to and is accountable to the council",2
"The director is also the accountable officer for the purposes of the Higher Education Funding Council for England Financial MemorandumThe LSE's current director is Dame Nemat Shafik, who replaced interim director, Professor Julia Black, on 1 September 2017The director is supported by a deputy director and provost who oversees the heads of academic departments and institutes, three pro-directors each with designated portfolios (teaching and learning, research and planning and resources) and the school secretary who acts as company secretary",2
" † Titled as director and president     Academic departments and institutes   LSE's research and teaching is organised into a network of independent academic departments established by the LSE Council, the school's governing body, on the advice of the academic board, the school's senior academic authority There are currently 27 academic departments or institutes    Finances   The LSE group has an endowment (as of 31 July 2016) of £119M and had a total income for 2015–16 (excluding donations and endowments) of £311M (£293M in 2014–15) with expenditure of £307M (2014–15 £302M)",2
"Key sources of income included £177M from tuition fees and education contacts (2014–15 £167M), £25M from funding council grants (2014–15 £22M), £32M from research grants (2014–15 – £27M) and £5.3M from investment income (2014–15 £4.7M).The Times Higher Education Pay Survey 2017 revealed that, among larger, non-specialist institutions, LSE professors and academics were the highest paid in the UK, with average incomes of £103,886 and £65,177 respectively     Endowment    The London School of Economics (LSE) is aiming to increase the size of its endowment fund to more than £1bn, which would make it one of the best resourced institutions in the UK and the world",2
"The effort was initiated in 2016 by Lord Myners, then chairman of the LSE's Council and Court of GovernorsThe plan includes working with wealthy alumni of LSE to make large contributions, increasing the annual budget surplus, and launching a new, widescale alumni donor campaignThe plan to grow LSE's endowment to more than £1bn has been continued by Lord Myners' successors at the LSEThe LSE has stated that currently ""limited endowment funding constrains our ability to offer 'needs blind' admission to students""",2
"    Academic year   LSE continues to adopt a three-term structure and has not moved to semestersMichaelmas Term runs from October to mid-December, Lent Term from mid-January to late March and Summer Term from late April to mid-June Certain departments operate reading weeks in early November and mid-February    Logo, arms and mascot    The school's historic coat of arms is used on official documentation including degree certificates and transcripts and includes the motto – rerum cognoscere causas, a line taken from Virgil’s Georgics meaning ""to know the causes of things"", together with the school's mascot – a beaver",2
"Both these symbols, adopted in February 1922, continue to be held in high regard to this day with the beaver chosen because of its representation as ""a hard working and industrious yet sociable animal"", attributes that the founders hoped LSE students to both possess and aspire toThe school's weekly newspaper is still entitled The Beaver, Rosebery residence hall's bar is called the Tipsy Beaver and LSE sports teams are known as the Beavers",2
"The institution has two sets of colours – brand and academic – red being the brand colour used on signage, publications and in buildings across campus and purple, black and gold for academic purposes including presentation ceremonies and graduation dressLSE's present 'red block' logo was adopted as part of a rebrand in the early 2000s, before which the school's coat of arms was used exclusively to represent the institutionAs a trademarked brand, it is carefully protected but can be produced in various forms to reflect different requirements",2
" In its full form it contains the full name of the institution to the right of the block with a further small empty red square at the end, but it is adapted for each academic department or professional service division to provide a cohesive brand across the institution    Academic profile       Admissions    The LSE received 20,000 applications for 1,600 undergraduate places in 2017, or 12.5 applicants per placeAll undergraduate applications, including international applications, are made through UCAS",2
"LSE had the 15th highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2018–19, with new students averaging 168 UCAS points, equivalent to A*A*A* or ABBB in A-level gradesThe university gave offers of admission to 37.0% of its applicants in 2015, the 3rd lowest amongst the Russell Group.Postgraduate students at the LSE are required to have a first or upper second Class UK honours degree, or its foreign equivalent, for master's degrees, while direct entry to the MPhil/PhD programme requires a UK taught master's with merit, or foreign equivalent",2
"Admission to the diploma requires a UK degree or equivalent plus relevant experienceThe intake to applications ratio for postgraduate degree programmes is very competitive; the MSc Financial Mathematics had a ratio of just over 4% in 2016.31.6% of LSE's undergraduates are privately educated, the ninth highest proportion amongst mainstream British universitiesIn the 2016–17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 33:18:50 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female-to-male ratio of 52:47",2
"    Programmes and degrees   LSE is the only university in the United Kingdom dedicated solely to the study and research of social sciencesLSE awards a range of academic degrees spanning bachelors, masters and PhDsThe post-nominals awarded are the degree abbreviations used commonly among British universities The school offers over 140 MSc programmes, 5 MPA programmes, an LLM, 30 BSc programmes, an LLB, 4 BA programmes (including International History and Geography), and 35 PhD programmes",2
"Subjects pioneered in Britain by LSE include accountancy and sociology, and the school also employed Britain's first full-time lecturer in economic historyCourses are split across more than thirty research centres and nineteen departments, plus a Language CentreSince programmes are all within the social sciences, they closely resemble each other, and undergraduate students usually take at least one course module in a subject outside of their degree for their first and second years of study, promoting a broader education in the social sciences",2
"At undergraduate level, some departments have as few as 90 students across the three years of studySince September 2010, it has been compulsory for first year undergraduates to participate in LSE 100: Understanding the Causes of Things alongside normal studies.From 1902, following its absorption into the University of London, until 2007, all degrees were awarded by the federal university in common with all other colleges of the universityThis system was changed in 2007 to enable some colleges to award their own degrees",2
"LSE was granted the power to begin awarding its own degrees from July 2008All students entering from the 2007–08 academic year onwards received an LSE degree, while students who started before this date were issued University of London degreesIn conjunction with NYU Stern and HEC Paris, LSE also offers the TRIUM Executive MBAThis was globally ranked third among executive MBAs by the Financial Times in 2016    Research   In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, LSE had the joint highest percentage of world-leading research among research submitted of any institution that entered more than one unit of assessment and was ranked third by cumulative grade point average with a score of 3.35, beating both Oxford and Cambridge",2
"It was ranked 23rd in the country for research power by Research Fortnight based on its REF2014 results, and 28th in research power by the Times Higher EducationThis followed the Research Assessment Exercise in 2008 where the school was placed second equal nationally on GPA, first for fraction of world-leading (4*) research and fourth for fraction of world-leading or internationally excellent (3* and 4*) research in LSE's analysis of the results, fourth equal for GPA and 29th for research power in Times Higher Education's analysis, and 27th in research power by Research Fortnight's analysis.According to analysis of the REF 2014 subject results by Times Higher Education, the school is the UK's top research university in terms of GPA of research submitted in business and management; area studies; and communication, cultural and media studies, library and information management, and second in law; politics and international studies; economics and econometrics; and social work and social policy",2

"Managerial economics is a branch of economics involving the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process.And, Managerial Economics is the integration of economic theory with business practice for the purpose of facilitating Decision making and forward planning by the ManagementManagerial economics aims to provide a framework for decision making which are directed to maximise the profits and outcomes of a company  Managerial economics focuses on increasing the efficiency of organizations by employing all possible business resources to increase output while decreasing unproductive activities",2
"The two main purposes of managerial economics are:  To optimize decision making when the firm is faced with problems or obstacles, with the consideration of macro and microeconomic theories and principlesTo analyse the possible effects and implications of both short and long-term planning decisions on the revenue and profitability of the Business.To correctly optimise economic decisions, both managerial economics objectives may involve the use of operations research, mathematical programming, strategic decision making, game theory and other computational methods",2
"The methods listed above are typically used for making quantitate decisions by data analysis techniquesThe theory of Managerial Economics includes a focus on; incentives, business organization, biases, advertising, innovation, uncertainty, pricing, analytics, and competitionIn other words, managerial economics is a combination of economic and managerial theory It helps the manager in decision-making and acts as a link between practice and theoryFurthermore, managerial economics provides the device and techniques for managers to make the best possible decisions for any scenario",2
Some examples of the types of questions that the tools provided by  managerial economics can answer are;  The price and quantity of a good a business should produceWhether to invest in current staff by training or go to market for staffWhen to retire fleet equipment.Managerial economics is sometimes referred to as business economics and is a branch of economics that applies microeconomic analysis to decision methods of businesses or other management units to aid managers to make a wide array of multifaceted decisions,2
" The calculation and quantitative analysis draws heavily from techniques such as regression analysis, correlation and calculus    Nature of Managerial Economics   Managerial economics to a certain degree is prescriptive in nature as it suggests a course of action to a managerial problemManagerial economics aims to provide the tools and techniques to make informed decisions to maximize the profits and minimize the losses of a firmManagerial economics has use in many different business applications, although the most common areas of its focus are in relation to the Risk, Pricing, Production and Capital decisions a manager makes.The decision making steps, which are guided by the tools of managerial economics, include;  1",2
"Define The problem The first step in making a business decision is to understand the problem in its entiretyWithout correct analysis on the problem at hand, developing a solution is an almost impossible taskNot correctly defining the problem can sometimes be the root of the problem that is trying to be solved.2Determine the Objective The second step is evaluating the objective of the decision, or what the decision is trying to achieve",2
" This step is determining a possible solution to the problem defined in step 1This step may provide multiple possible solutions to the problem previously defined3Discover the Alternatives After in depth analysis into what is required to solve the problem faced by a business, options for potential solutions can be collatedIn most cases, more than one possible solution to the problem existsFor example, a business striving to gain more attraction on social media could improve the quality of their content, collaborate with other creators or a combination of the two.4",2
"Forecast the Consequences This step involves assessing the consequences of the problem solutions detailed in step 3Possible consequences of a business decisions could include; productivity, health, environmental impacts and riskHere, managerial economics is used to determine the risks and potential financial consequences of an action5Make a Decision After the consequences and potential solutions to the problem at hand have been analyzed, a decision can be madeAt this point, the potential decisions should be measurable values which have been quantified by managerial economics to maximise profits, minimise risk and adverse outcomes of the firm",2
"The make a decision step includes a sensitivity analysis of the solutionA sensitivity analysis of the selected solution provides detail of how the output of the solution changes with changes to the inputsThe sensitivity analysis allows the strengths and weaknesses of the designed solution to be analyzed    Managerial Economics Forces   When making managerial decisions, managers use managerial economics to analyze the micro and macroeconomic environmentsMicroeconomics considers the actions of individual firms",2
"In comparison, Macroeconomics is considers the actions and behaviour of the economy as a wholeManagerial economics studies how to analyze and compare alternative solutions to find the one most likely to achieve business goalsIn this decision-making process, the role of managerial economics is to provide relevant analytical tools and analytical methodsForecasting and analysis of macroeconomic trends are essential in managerial economicsThe macroeconomy focuses broadly on the principles of output, unemployment, political and social issues, inflation and other economic conditions.These values play a large factor in managerial economics as they have the ability to provide an overview of global market conditions, which is imperative for managers to understand.The political structure of a country, whether authoritarian or democratic; Political stability; And attitudes towards the private sector affect the growth and development of organizations",2
"An example of managerial economics using macroeconomic principles is a manager choosing to hire new staff rather than training old ones in a time where the rate of unemployment is high, as the possible talent pool would be very largeThe microeconomic consideration by managerial economics includes; consumer demand and supply, opportunity cost, revenue and costMicroeconomics also gives indication on the most effective allocation of resources the business has available to it",2
"These microeconomic theories and considerations are used via managerial economics to make decisions regarding the businessBy understanding the principles of microeconomics, managers can be well informed to make accurate decisions regarding the formAn example of managerial economics using microeconomic principles is the decision of a manager to increase the price of the goods being soldA manager should evaluate the price elasticity of the product to equate the respective demand of the product after the price change",2
"    The Main Theories of Managerial Economics   Microeconomics is the dominant focus behind managerial economics, some of the key aspects include; 1Supply and Demand  The law of supply and demand describes the relationship between producers and consumers of a productThe law suggests that price set by the producer and quantity demanded by a consumer are inversely proportional, meaning an increase in the price set is met by a reduction in demand by the consumer",2
"The law further describes that sellers will provide a large quantity of the good if it sells at a high price.2Production theory Production theory describes the quantity of a good a business chooses to produce due to multiple factorsThese factors include; raw material inputs, labor, machinery costs, capital, etcThe production theory states that a business will strive to employ the cheapest combination of inputs to produce the quantity demanded",2
"The production function can be described by the function below; Formula: Q   F[L,K] Where Q denotes production from a firm, L is the variable inputs and K is the fixed inputs.3Opportunity Cost The opportunity cost is a value that represents the cost of opportunities it misses out on by conducting another activityThe opportunity cost details the costs and benefits of each action the business is considering pursuing, the decision maker is then in the position to choose the action with the highest payoff.4.Theory of Exchange or Price Theory The principle uses the conjecture of supply and demand to set an accurate price for a good",2
"The aim of the price theory is to allocate a price for a good such that the supply of a good is met with equal demand for the productIf a manager sets a price to high for the good, the consumer may think it is not worth the cost and decide not to purchase the good, hence creating an excess in supplyThe opposite occurs when the price is set too low, this causes demand for a good to be larger than the supply.5.Theory of Capital and Investment Decisions Capital is the most critical factor in an enterprise, this theory prevails in the rational allocation of funds and decisions of organizations to invest in profitable projects or enterprises in order to improve the efficiency of organizations",2
"The rational allocation of funds may include acquiring business, investing in equipment, whether investment will improve the business at all.The microeconomic principles are useful principles for managers to make decisions, Managerial economics entails the use of all of these analysis tools to make informed business decisions    Analytical Methods used in Managerial Economics   1Price Elasticity Analysis The price elasticity is an extremely useful tool in managerial economics as it provides managers with the predicted change in demand associated with an increase in the price charged for a good",2
"The price elasticity principle also outlines the changes in demand for goods with changes in the income of a populous.Formula; Elasticity   (△Q/△P)*(Q0/P0) Where △Q is the change in demand for the respective change in price △P, with Q0 and P0 representing the quantity and price of good before a change was madeThe price elasticity is extremely important for managerial economics as it aids in the optimization of the marginal revenue of firms.2",2
"Marginal analysis In economics, margin is the change in revenue and cost by producing one extra unit of outputBoth the marginal cost and marginal revenue are extremely important in marginal economics as profit of a firm is maximized when the marginal cost is equal to the marginal revenue.3Mathematical model analysis In the development of economics and management, more and more econometric analysis methods are appliedThe use of differential calculus is a powerful tool in managerial economics.By taking the derivative of a function the maximum and minimum values of the function are very easily determined by setting the derivative equal to zero, an example of this is finding a quantity of production that maximizes the profit of the firm",2
"This concept is important for managers to understand in order to minimize costs or maximize profits    When Managerial Economics is Applied   Almost any business decision can be analyzed with managerial economics techniques, but it is most commonly applied to:  Risk analysis – various models are used to quantify risk and asymmetric information and to employ them in decision rules to manage riskProduction analysis – microeconomic techniques are used to analyze production efficiency, optimum factor allocation, costs, economies of scale and to estimate the firm's cost function",2
"Pricing analysis – microeconomic techniques are used to analyze various pricing decisions including transfer pricing, joint product pricing, price discrimination, price elasticity estimations, and choosing the optimum pricing methodCapital budgeting – investment theory is used to examine a firm's capital purchasing decisions.At its core managerial economics is a decision-making process, by taking two or more options and optimizing a business decision while considering fixed resources to the function    Incentives   Monetary incentives are an important aspect of managerial economics as they can be used to achieve particular business outcomes",2
"Monetary incentives allow for a particular behavior to appear more attractive to employees and contractorsAn example of this is when an agent receives a bonus for reaching a specific outcome, usually determined by an objective measurement tool, such as a key performance indicatorProviding this incentive allows the business to reach particular goals that would not otherwise be achievedProviding monetary incentives can also bring an opposite effect, dissuading the agent from performing the incentivized behavior",2
"An example of this is when an agent is provided with a base salary independent of achieving a particular goal set by managementIn this scenario there is no incentive for the agent to act in accordance the goal as they will receive their salary regardless.Employees do not just perform in accordance with their own pay but also the pay of their peersPay inequality can act as a disincentive, reducing employee output and attendance by a significant amount",2
It is irrelevant whether they have a higher or lower salary than that of their co-workersPay disparity also lowers the ability of employees to work in their own interests and cooperate with other workers effectivelyPay inequality may have no discernible effect if an employee is aware that a peer with a higher salary produces a greater output than them.Tournament theory is used to describe why different pay levels exist between different roles in the business hierarchy,2
"The idea of tournament theory is that agents who put in effort to achieve promotions are rewarded with a higher, non-incremental, pay rateThe reward of a higher pay rate incentivizes behavior that leads to promotionsThis behavior is often lucrative and therefore ideal for the businessTournaments can be very powerful at incentivizing performanceEmpirical research in economics and managements have shown that tournament-like incentive structure increases the individual performance or workers and managers in the workplace",2

"A service is an ""(intangible) act or use for which a consumer, firmor government is willing to pay."" Examples include work done by barbers, doctors, lawyers, mechanics, banks, insurance companies, and so on  Public services are those that society (nation state, fiscal union or region) as a whole pays forUsing resources, skill, ingenuity, and experience, service providers benefit service consumersService is intangible in natureServices may be defined as acts or performances whereby the service provider provides value to the customer",2
" In a narrower sense, service refers to quality of customer service: the measured appropriateness of assistance and support provided to a customerThis particular usage occurs frequently in retailing    Two I's   Services can be described in terms of I's    Intangibility   Services are by definition intangibleThey are not manufactured, transported or stockedOne cannot store services for future useThey are produced and consumed simultaneously    Perishability   Services are perishable in two regards:  Service-relevant resources, processes, and systems are assigned for service delivery during a specific period in time",2
"If the service consumer does not request and consume the service during this period, the related resources may go unusedFrom the perspective of the service provider, this is a lost business opportunity if no other use for those resources is availableExamples: A hairdresser serves another clientAn empty seat on an airplane cannot be filled after departureWhen the service has been completely rendered to the consumer, this particular service irreversibly vanishes",2
"Example: a passenger has been transported to the destination.The service provider must deliver the service at the exact time of service consumptionThe service is not manifested in a physical object that is independent of the providerThe service consumer is also inseparable from service deliveryExamples: The service consumer must sit in the hairdresser's chair, or in the airplane seatCorrespondingly, the hairdresser or the pilot must be in the shop or plane, respectively, to deliver the service",2
"    Inconsistency (variability)   Each service is uniqueIt can never be exactly repeated as the time, location, circumstances, conditions, current configurations and/or assigned resources are different for the next delivery, even if the same service is requested by the consumerMany services are regarded as heterogeneous and are typically modified for each service-consumer or for each service-contextExample: The taxi service which transports the service consumer from home to work is different from the taxi service which transports the same service consumer from work to home – another point in time, the other direction, possibly another route, probably another taxi-driver and cab",2
"Another and more common term for this is  heterogeneity    Service quality   Mass generation and delivery of services must be mastered for a service provider to expandThis can be seen as a problem of service qualityBoth inputs and outputs to the processes involved providing services are highly variable, as are the relationships between these processes, making it difficult to maintain consistent service qualityMany services involve variable human activity, rather than a precisely determined process; exceptions include utilities",2
"The human factor is often the key success factor in service provisionDemand can vary by season, time of day, business cycle, etcConsistency is necessary to create enduring business relationships    Specification   Any service can be clearly and completely, consistently and concisely specified by means of standard attributes that conform to the MECE principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) Service consumer benefits – (set of) benefits that are triggerable, consumable and effectively utilizable for any authorized service consumer and that are rendered upon request",2
"These benefits must be described in terms that are meaningful to consumersService-specific functional parameters – parameters that are essential to the respective service and that describe the important dimension(s) of the servicescape, the service output or the service outcome, e.gwhether the passenger sits in an aisle or window seatService delivery point – the physical location and/or logical interface where the benefits of the service are rendered to the consumer",2
"At this point the service delivery preparation can be assessed and delivery can be monitored and controlledService consumer count – the number of consumers that are enabled to consume a serviceService delivery readiness time – the moments when the service is available and all the specified service elements are available at the delivery point Service consumer support times – the moments when the support team (""service desk"") is availableThe service desk is the Single Point of Contact (SPoC) for service inquiries",2
"At those times, the service desk can be reached via commonly available communication methods (phone, web, etc.) Service consumer support language – the language(s) spoken by the service deskService fulfillment target – the provider's promise to deliver the service, expressed as the ratio of the count of successful service deliveries to the count of service requests by a single consumer or consumer group over some time periodService impairment duration – the maximum allowable interval between the first occurrence of a service impairment and the full resumption and completion of the service delivery",2
"Service delivery duration – the maximum allowable period for effectively rendering all service benefits to the consumerService delivery unit – the scope/number of action(s) that constitute a delivered serviceServes as the reference object for the Service Delivering Price, for all service costs as well as for charging and billingService delivery price – the amount of money the customer pays to receive a serviceTypically, the price includes a service access price that qualifies the consumer to request the service and a service consumption price for each delivered service",2
"    Delivery    The delivery of a service typically involves six factors:  Service provider (workers and managers) Equipment used to provide the service (e.gvehicles, cash registers, technical systems, computer systems) Physical facilities (e.gbuildings, parking, waiting rooms) Service consumer Other customers at the service delivery location Customer contactThe service encounter is defined as all activities involved in the service delivery processSome service managers use the term ""moment of truth"" to indicate that point in a service encounter where interactions are most intense",2
"Many business theorists view service provision as a performance or act (sometimes humorously referred to as dramalurgy, perhaps in reference to dramaturgy)The location of the service delivery is referred to as the stage and the objects that facilitate the service process are called propsA script is a sequence of behaviors followed by those involved, including the client(s)Some service dramas are tightly scripted, others are more ad libRole congruence occurs when each actor follows a script that harmonizes with the roles played by the other actors",2
"In some service industries, especially health care, dispute resolution and social services, a popular concept is the idea of the caseload, which refers to the total number of patients, clients, litigants, or claimants for which a given employee is responsibleEmployees must balance the needs of each individual case against the needs of all other current cases as well as their own needsUnder English law, if a service provider is induced to deliver services to a dishonest client by a deception, this is an offence under the Theft Act 1978",2
Lovelock used the number of delivery sites (whether single or multiple) and the method of delivery to classify services in a 2 x 3 matrixThen implications are that the convenience of receiving the service is the lowest when the customer has to come to the service and must use a single or specific outletConvenience increases (to a point) as the number of service points increase    Service-commodity goods continuum    The distinction between a good and a service remains disputed,2
"The perspective in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries focused on creation and possession of wealthClassical economists contended that goods were objects of value over which ownership rights could be established and exchangedOwnership implied tangible possession of an object that had been acquired through purchase, barter or gift from the producer or previous owner and was legally identifiable as the property of the current ownerAdam Smith’s famous book, The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, distinguished between the outputs of what he termed ""productive"" and ""unproductive"" labor",2
"The former, he stated, produced goods that could be stored after production and subsequently exchanged for money or other items of valueThe latter, however useful or necessary, created services that perished at the time of production and therefore did not contribute to wealthBuilding on this theme, French economist Jean-Baptiste Say argued that production and consumption were inseparable in services, coining the term ""immaterial products"" to describe themMost modern business theorists describe a continuum with pure service on one terminal point and pure commodity good on the other",2
"Most products fall between these two extremesFor example, a restaurant provides a physical good (the food), but also provides services in the form of ambience, the setting and clearing of the table, etcAnd although some utilities actually deliver physical goods — like water utilities that deliver water — utilities are usually treated as services    Service types   The following is a list of service industries, grouped into sectorsParenthetical notations indicate how specific occupations and organizations can be regarded as service industries to the extent they provide an intangible service, as opposed to a tangible good",2
" Business functions (that apply to all organizations in general) Consulting Customer service Human resources administrators (providing services like ensuring that employees are paid accurately) Cleaning, patronage, repair and maintenance services Gardeners Janitors (who provide cleaning services) Mechanics Construction Carpentry Electricians (offering the service of making wiring work properly) Plumbing Death care Coroners (who provide the service of identifying cadavers and determining time and cause of death) Funeral homes (who prepare corpses for public display, cremation or burial) Dispute resolution and prevention services Arbitration Courts of law (who perform the service of dispute resolution backed by the power of the state) Diplomacy Incarceration (provides the service of keeping criminals out of society) Law enforcement (provides the service of identifying and apprehending criminals) Lawyers (who perform the services of advocacy and decisionmaking in many dispute resolution and prevention processes) Mediation Military (performs the service of protecting states in disputes with other states) Negotiation (not really a service unless someone is negotiating on behalf of another) Education (institutions offering the services of teaching and access to information) Library Museum School Entertainment (when provided live or within a highly specialized facility) Gambling Movie theatres (providing the service of showing a movie on a big screen) Performing arts productions Sexual services Sport Television Fabric care Dry cleaning Laundry Financial services Accountancy Banks and building societies (offering lending services and safekeeping of money and valuables) Real estate Stock brokerages Tax services Valuation Foodservice industry Health care (all health care professions provide services) Hospitality industry Information services Data processing Database services Interpreting Translation Personal grooming Body hair removal Dental hygienist Hairdressing Manicurist / pedicurist Public utility Electric power Natural gas Telecommunications Waste management Water industry Risk management Insurance Security Social services Social work Childcare Elderly care Logistics Transport Warehousing Stock management Packaging     List of countries by tertiary output    Below is a list of countries by service output at market exchange rates at peak level as of",2
The Advanced Placement Psychology (also known as AP Psychology or AP Psych) course and corresponding exam are part of College Board's Advanced Placement ProgramThis course is tailored for students interested in the field of psychology and as an opportunity to earn Advanced Placement credit or exemption from a college-level psychology courseIt was the shortest AP exam until the AP Physics C exam was split into two separate exams in 2006,3
"AP Psychology is often considered one of the easier AP exams; relative to the other tests, the material is rather straightforward and much easier to self-studyAmong all the social studies Advanced Placement exams, the Psych exam had the second-highest passing rate in 2018    Topics covered   The College Board provides a course of study to help educators prepare their students for the AP Psychology examThe exam covers the following 9 areas",3
"The percentage indicates the portion of the multiple-choice section of the exam focused on each content area:     Exam    The exam includes two sections: a 70-minute multiple choice section (100 questions) and a 50-minute free response section (2 prompts)The multiple choice provides two-thirds of the grade and the free-response provides the remaining third.Beginning with the May 2011 AP Exam administration, total scores on the multiple-choice section are based only on the number of questions answered correctly",3
"Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of mental processes such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and reasoning.Cognitive psychology originated in the 1960s in a break from behaviorism, which had held from the 1920s to 1950s that unobservable mental processes were outside of the realm of empirical scienceThis break came as researchers in linguistics and cybernetics as well as applied psychology used models of mental processing to explain human behavior",3
"Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into other branches of psychology and various other modern disciplines such as cognitive science, linguistics, and economicsThe domain of cognitive psychology overlaps with that of cognitive science, which takes a more interdisciplinary approach and includes studies of non-human subjects and artificial intelligence    History   Philosophically, ruminations of the human mind and its processes have been around since the times of the ancient Greeks",3
"In 387 BCE, Plato is known to have suggested that the brain was the seat of the mental processesIn 1637, René Descartes posited that humans are born with innate ideas, and forwarded the idea of mind-body dualism, which would come to be known as substance dualism (essentially the idea that the mind and the body are two separate substances)From that time, major debates ensued through the 19th century regarding whether human thought was solely experiential (empiricism), or included innate knowledge (rationalism)",3
"Some of those involved in this debate included George Berkeley and John Locke on the side of empiricism, and Immanuel Kant on the side of nativism.With the philosophical debate continuing, the mid to late 19th century was a critical time in the development of psychology as a scientific disciplineTwo discoveries that would later play substantial roles in cognitive psychology were Paul Broca's discovery of the area of the brain largely responsible for language production, and Carl Wernicke's discovery of an area thought to be mostly responsible for comprehension of language",3
"Both areas were subsequently formally named for their founders, and disruptions of an individual's language production or comprehension due to trauma or malformation in these areas have come to commonly be known as Broca's aphasia and Wernicke's aphasiaFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, the main approach to psychology was behaviorismInitially, its adherents viewed mental events such as thoughts, ideas, attention, and consciousness as unobservables, hence outside the realm of a science of psychology",3
"One pioneer of cognitive psychology, who worked outside the boundaries (both intellectual and geographical) of behaviorism was Jean PiagetFrom 1926 to the 1950s and into the 1980s, he studied the thoughts, language, and intelligence of children and adults.In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:  With the development of new warfare technology during WWII, the need for a greater understanding of human performance came to prominence",3
"Problems such as how to best train soldiers to use new technology and how to deal with matters of attention while under duress became areas of need for military personnelBehaviorism provided little if any insight into these matters and it was the work of Donald Broadbent, integrating concepts from human performance research and the recently developed information theory, that forged the way in this areaDevelopments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of psychological thought",3
"Allen Newell and Herbert Simon spent years developing the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AIThis encouraged a conceptualization of mental functions patterned on the way that computers handled such things as memory storage and retrieval, and it opened an important doorway for cognitivismNoam Chomsky's 1959 critique of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the ""cognitive revolution""",3
"Inside psychology, in criticism of behaviorism, JSBruner, JJGoodnow & GAAustin wrote ""a study of thinking"" in 1956In 1960, GAMiller, EGalanter and KPribram wrote their famous ""Plans and the Structure of Behavior""The same year, Bruner and Miller founded the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies, which institutionalized the revolution and launched the field of cognitive scienceFormal recognition of the field involved the establishment of research institutions such as George Mandler's Center for Human Information Processing in 1964",3
"Mandler described the origins of cognitive psychology in a 2002 article in the Journal of the History of the Behavioral SciencesUlric Neisser put the term ""cognitive psychology"" into common use through his book Cognitive Psychology, published in 1967Neisser's definition of ""cognition"" illustrates the then-progressive concept of cognitive processes:  The term ""cognition"" refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and usedIt is concerned with these processes even when they operate in the absence of relevant stimulation, as in images and hallucinations",3
"..Given such a sweeping definition, it is apparent that cognition is involved in everything a human being might possibly do; that every psychological phenomenon is a cognitive phenomenonBut although cognitive psychology is concerned with all human activity rather than some fraction of it, the concern is from a particular point of viewOther viewpoints are equally legitimate and necessaryDynamic psychology, which begins with motives rather than with sensory input, is a case in point",3
"Instead of asking how a man's actions and experiences result from what he saw, remembered, or believed, the dynamic psychologist asks how they follow from the subject's goals, needs, or instincts    Cognitive processes    The main focus of cognitive psychologists is on the mental processes that affect behaviorThose processes include, but are not limited to, the following three stages of memory:  Sensory memory storage: holds sensory information Short-term memory storage: holds information temporarily for analysis and retrieves information from the Long-term memory",3
"Long-term memory: holds information over an extended period of time which receives information from the short-term memory    Attention    The psychological definition of attention is ""a state of focused awareness on a subset of the available perceptual information""A key function of attention is to identify irrelevant data and filter it out, enabling significant data to be distributed to the other mental processesFor example, the human brain may simultaneously receive auditory, visual, olfactory, taste, and tactile information",3
"The brain is able to consciously handle only a small subset of this information, and this is accomplished through the attentional processes.Attention can be divided into two major attentional systems: exogenous control and endogenous controlExogenous control works in a bottom-up manner and is responsible for orienting reflex, and pop-out effectsEndogenous control works top-down and is the more deliberate attentional system, responsible for divided attention and conscious processing.One major focal point relating to attention within the field of cognitive psychology is the concept of divided attention",3
"A number of early studies dealt with the ability of a person wearing headphones to discern meaningful conversation when presented with different messages into each ear; this is known as the dichotic listening taskKey findings involved an increased understanding of the mind's ability to both focus on one message, while still being somewhat aware of information being taken in from the ear not being consciously attended toFor example, participants (wearing earphones) may be told that they will be hearing separate messages in each ear and that they are expected to attend only to information related to basketball",3
"When the experiment starts, the message about basketball will be presented to the left ear and non-relevant information will be presented to the right earAt some point the message related to basketball will switch to the right ear and the non-relevant information to the left earWhen this happens, the listener is usually able to repeat the entire message at the end, having attended to the left or right ear only when it was appropriate",3
"The ability to attend to one conversation in the face of many is known as the cocktail party effectOther major findings include that participants cannot comprehend both passages when shadowing one passage, they cannot report the content of the unattended message,  while they can shadow a message better if the pitches in each ear are differentHowever, while deep processing does not occur, early sensory processing doesSubjects did notice if the pitch of the unattended message changed or if it ceased altogether, and some even oriented to the unattended message if their name was mentioned",3
"    Memory   The two main types of memory are short-term memory and long-term memory; however, short-term memory has become better understood to be working memoryCognitive psychologists often study memory in terms of working memory     Working memory     Though working memory is often thought of as just short-term memory, it is more clearly defined as the ability to process and maintain temporary information in a wide range of everyday activities in the face of distraction",3
"The famously known capacity of memory of 7 plus or minus 2 is a combination of both memories in working memory and long-term memoryOne of the classic experiments is by Ebbinghaus, who found the serial position effect where information from the beginning and end of the list of random words were better recalled than those in the centerThis primacy and recency effect varies in intensity based on list lengthIts typical U-shaped curve can be disrupted by an attention-grabbing word; this is known as the Von Restorff effect",3
" Many models of working memory have been madeOne of the most regarded is the Baddeley and Hitch model of working memoryIt takes into account both visual and auditory stimuli, long-term memory to use as a reference, and a central processor to combine and understand it allA large part of memory is forgetting, and there is a large debate among psychologists of decay theory versus interference theory     Long-term memory     Modern conceptions of memory are usually about long-term memory and break it down into three main sub-classes",3
"These three classes are somewhat hierarchical in nature, in terms of the level of conscious thought related to their useProcedural memory is memory for the performance of particular types of actionIt is often activated on a subconscious level, or at most requires a minimal amount of conscious effortProcedural memory includes stimulus-response-type information, which is activated through association with particular tasks, routines, etcA person is using procedural knowledge when they seemingly ""automatically"" respond in a particular manner to a particular situation or process",3
"An example is driving a carSemantic memory is the encyclopedic knowledge that a person possessesKnowledge like what the Eiffel Tower looks like, or the name of a friend from sixth grade, represent semantic memoryAccess of semantic memory ranges from slightly to extremely effortful, depending on a number of variables including but not limited to recency of encoding of the information, number of associations it has to other information, frequency of access, and levels of meaning (how deeply it was processed when it was encoded)",3
"Episodic memory is the memory of autobiographical events that can be explicitly statedIt contains all memories that are temporal in nature, such as when one last brushed one's teeth or where one was when one heard about a major news eventEpisodic memory typically requires the deepest level of conscious thought, as it often pulls together semantic memory and temporal information to formulate the entire memory    Perception   Perception involves both the physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and proprioception) as well as the cognitive processes involved in interpreting those senses",3
"Essentially, it is how people come to understand the world around them through the interpretation of stimuliEarly psychologists like Edward BTitchener began to work with perception in their structuralist approach to psychologyStructuralism dealt heavily with trying to reduce human thought (or ""consciousness"", as Titchener would have called it) into its most basic elements by gaining an understanding of how an individual perceives particular stimuli.Current perspectives on perception within cognitive psychology tend to focus on particular ways in which the human mind interprets stimuli from the senses and how these interpretations affect behavior",3
"An example of the way in which modern psychologists approach the study of perception is the research being done at the Center for Ecological Study of Perception and Action at the University of Connecticut (CESPA)One study at CESPA concerns ways in which individuals perceive their physical environment and how that influences their navigation through that environment    Language   Psychologists have had an interest in the cognitive processes involved with language that dates back to the 1870s, when Carl Wernicke proposed a model for the mental processing of language",3
"Current work on language within the field of cognitive psychology varies widelyCognitive psychologists may study language acquisition, individual components of language formation (like phonemes), how language use is involved in mood, or numerous other related areas Significant work has been done recently with regard to understanding the timing of language acquisition and how it can be used to determine if a child has, or is at risk of, developing a learning disability",3
"A study from 2012, showed that while this can be an effective strategy, it is important that those making evaluations include all relevant information when making their assessmentsFactors such as individual variability, socioeconomic status, short-term and long-term memory capacity, and others must be included in order to make valid assessments    Metacognition   Metacognition, in a broad sense, is the thoughts that a person has about their own thoughtsMore specifically, metacognition includes things like:  How effective a person is at monitoring their own performance on a given task (self-regulation)",3
A person's understanding of their capabilities on particular mental tasksThe ability to apply cognitive strategies.Much of the current study regarding metacognition within the field of cognitive psychology deals with its application within the area of educationBeing able to increase a student's metacognitive abilities has been shown to have a significant impact on their learning and study habitsOne key aspect of this concept is the improvement of students' ability to set goals and self-regulate effectively to meet those goals,3
"As a part of this process, it is also important to ensure that students are realistically evaluating their personal degree of knowledge and setting realistic goals (another metacognitive task).Common phenomena related to metacognition include:  Déjà Vu: feeling of a repeated experience Cryptomnesia: generating thought believing it is unique but it is actually a memory of a past experience; also known as unconscious plagiarismFalse Fame Effect: non-famous names can be made to be famous Validity effect: statements seem more valid upon repeated exposure Imagination inflation: imagining an event that did not occur and having increased confidence that it did occur     Modern perspectives   Modern perspectives on cognitive psychology generally address cognition as a dual process theory, expounded upon by Daniel Kahneman in 2011",3
"Kahneman differentiated the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoningIntuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning processKahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulateReasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes",3
"    Applications       Abnormal psychology   Following the cognitive revolution, and as a result of many of the principal discoveries to come out of the field of cognitive psychology, the discipline of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) evolvedAaron TBeck is generally regarded as the father of cognitive therapy, a particular type of CBT treatmentHis work in the areas of recognition and treatment of depression has gained worldwide recognitionIn his 1987 book titled Cognitive Therapy of Depression, Beck puts forth three salient points with regard to his reasoning for the treatment of depression by means of therapy or therapy and antidepressants versus using a pharmacological-only approach:  1",3
"Despite the prevalent use of antidepressants, the fact remains that not all patients respond to themBeck cites (in 1987) that only 60 to 65% of patients respond to antidepressants, and recent meta-analyses (a statistical breakdown of multiple studies) show very similar numbers.2Many of those who do respond to antidepressants end up not taking their medications, for various reasonsThey may develop side-effects or have some form of personal objection to taking the drugs.3",3
"Beck posits that the use of psychotropic drugs may lead to an eventual breakdown in the individual's coping mechanismsHis theory is that the person essentially becomes reliant on the medication as a means of improving mood and fails to practice those coping techniques typically practiced by healthy individuals to alleviate the effects of depressive symptomsBy failing to do so, once the patient is weaned off of the antidepressants, they often are unable to cope with normal levels of depressed mood and feel driven to reinstate use of the antidepressants",3
"    Social psychology   Many facets of modern social psychology have roots in research done within the field of cognitive psychologySocial cognition is a specific sub-set of social psychology that concentrates on processes that have been of particular focus within cognitive psychology, specifically applied to human interactionsGordon BMoskowitz defines social cognition as ""..the study of the mental processes involved in perceiving, attending to, remembering, thinking about, and making sense of the people in our social world"".The development of multiple social information processing (SIP) models has been influential in studies involving aggressive and anti-social behavior",3
"Kenneth Dodge's SIP model is one of, if not the most, empirically supported models relating to aggressionAmong his research, Dodge posits that children who possess a greater ability to process social information more often display higher levels of socially acceptable behavior; that the type of social interaction that children have affects their relationshipsHis model asserts that there are five steps that an individual proceeds through when evaluating interactions with other individuals and that how the person interprets cues is key to their reactionary process",3
"    Developmental psychology   Many of the prominent names in the field of developmental psychology base their understanding of development on cognitive modelsOne of the major paradigms of developmental psychology, the Theory of Mind (ToM), deals specifically with the ability of an individual to effectively understand and attribute cognition to those around themThis concept typically becomes fully apparent in children between the ages of 4 and 6Essentially, before the child develops ToM, they are unable to understand that those around them can have different thoughts, ideas, or feelings than themselves",3
"The development of ToM is a matter of metacognition, or thinking about one's thoughtsThe child must be able to recognize that they have their own thoughts and in turn, that others possess thoughts of their own.One of the foremost minds with regard to developmental psychology, Jean Piaget, focused much of his attention on cognitive development from birth through adulthoodThough there have been considerable challenges to parts of his stages of cognitive development, they remain a staple in the realm of education",3
Piaget's concepts and ideas predated the cognitive revolution but inspired a wealth of research in the field of cognitive psychology and many of his principles have been blended with modern theory to synthesize the predominant views of today    Educational psychology   Modern theories of education have applied many concepts that are focal points of cognitive psychologySome of the most prominent concepts include:  Metacognition: Metacognition is a broad concept encompassing all manners of one's thoughts and knowledge about their own thinking,3
"A key area of educational focus in this realm is related to self-monitoring, which relates highly to how well students are able to evaluate their personal knowledge and apply strategies to improve knowledge in areas in which they are lackingDeclarative knowledge and procedural knowledge: Declarative knowledge is a persons 'encyclopedic' knowledge base, whereas procedural knowledge is specific knowledge relating to performing particular tasksThe application of these cognitive paradigms to education attempts to augment a student's ability to integrate declarative knowledge into newly learned procedures in an effort to facilitate accelerated learning",3
"Knowledge organization: Applications of cognitive psychology's understanding of how knowledge is organized in the brain has been a major focus within the field of education in recent yearsThe hierarchical method of organizing information and how that maps well onto the brain's memory are concepts that have proven extremely beneficial in classrooms    Personality psychology   Cognitive therapeutic approaches have received considerable attention in the treatment of personality disorders in recent yearsThe approach focuses on the formation of what it believes to be faulty schemata, centralized on judgmental biases and general cognitive errors",3
"    Cognitive psychology vscognitive science   The line between cognitive psychology and cognitive science can be blurryCognitive psychology is better understood as predominantly concerned with applied psychology and the understanding of psychological phenomenaCognitive psychologists are often heavily involved in running psychological experiments involving human participants, with the goal of gathering information related to how the human mind takes in, processes, and acts upon inputs received from the outside worldThe information gained in this area is then often used in the applied field of clinical psychology",3
"Cognitive science is better understood as predominantly concerned with a much broader scope, with links to philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, and particularly with artificial intelligenceIt could be said that cognitive science provides the corpus of information feeding the theories used by cognitive psychologistsCognitive scientists' research sometimes involves non-human subjects, allowing them to delve into areas which would come under ethical scrutiny if performed on human participantsI.e., they may do research implanting devices in the brains of rats to track the firing of neurons while the rat performs a particular task",3
"Cognitive science is highly involved in the area of artificial intelligence and its application to the understanding of mental processes    Criticisms       Lack of cohesion   Some observers have suggested that as cognitive psychology became a movement during the 1970s, the intricacies of the phenomena and processes it examined meant it also began to lose cohesion as a field of studyIn Psychology: Pythagoras to Present, for example, John Malone writes: ""Examinations of late twentieth-century textbooks dealing with ""cognitive psychology"", ""human cognition"", ""cognitive science"" and the like quickly reveal that there are many, many varieties of cognitive psychology and very little agreement about exactly what may be its domain.""  This misfortune produced competing models that questioned information-processing approaches to cognitive functioning such as Decision Making and Behavioral Sciences",3
"    Controversies   In the early years of cognitive psychology, behaviorist critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental statesHowever, cognitive neuroscience continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.There is however disagreement between neuropsychologists and cognitive psychologistsCognitive psychology has produced models of cognition which are not supported by modern brain scienceIt is often the case that the advocates of different cognitive models form a dialectic relationship with one another thus affecting empirical research, with researchers siding with their favorite theory",3
"For example, advocates of mental model theory have attempted to find evidence that deductive reasoning is based on image thinking, while the advocates of mental logic theory have tried to prove that it is based on verbal thinking, leading to a disorderly picture of the findings from brain imaging and brain lesion studiesWhen theoretical claims are put aside, the evidence shows that interaction depends on the type of task tested, whether of visuospatial or linguistical orientation; but that there is also an aspect of reasoning which is not covered by either theory.Similarly, neurolinguistics has found that it is easier to make sense of brain imaging studies when the theories are left aside",3
"In the field of language cognition research, generative grammar has taken the position that language resides within its private cognitive module, while 'Cognitive Linguistics' goes to the opposite extreme by claiming that language is not an independent function, but operates on general cognitive capacities such as visual processing and motor skillsConsensus in neuropsychology however takes the middle position that, while language is a specialized function, it overlaps or interacts with visual processing",3
"Nonetheless, much of the research in language cognition continues to be divided along the lines of generative grammar and Cognitive Linguistics; and this, again, affects adjacent research fields including language development and language acquisition    Major research areas       Influential cognitive psychologists       See also       References       Further reading   Groeger, John A(2002)""Trafficking in cognition: Applying cognitive psychology to driving""Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour5 (4): 235–248doi:10.1016/S1369-8478(03)00006-8Jacobs, A.M(2001)",3

"Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their lifeOriginally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespanDevelopmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life This field examines change across three major dimensions, which are physical development, cognitive development, and social emotional developmentWithin these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including motor skills, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept, and identity formation",3
"Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature and nurture on the process of human development, as well as processes of change in context across timeMany researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior, and environmental factorsThis includes the social context and the built environmentOngoing debates in regards to developmental psychology include biological essentialism vsneuroplasticity and stages of development vsdynamic systems of developmentDevelopmental psychology involves a range of fields, such as educational psychology, child psychopathology, forensic developmental psychology, child development, cognitive psychology, ecological psychology, and cultural psychology",3
"Influential developmental psychologists from the 20th century include Urie Bronfenbrenner, Erik Erikson, Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud, Jean Piaget, Barbara Rogoff, Esther Thelen, and Lev Vygotsky    Historical Antecedents   Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John BWatson are typically cited as providing the foundation for modern developmental psychologyIn the mid-18th century, Jean Jacques Rousseau described three stages of development: infants (infancy), puer (childhood) and adolescence in Emile: Or, On EducationRousseau's ideas were adopted and supported by educators at the time",3
"Developmental psychology generally focuses on how and why certain changes (cognitive, social, intellectual, personality) occur over time in the course of a human lifeMany theorists have made a profound contribution to this area of psychologyOne of them, Erik Erikson developed a model of eight stages of psychological developmentHe believed that humans developed in stages throughout their lifetimes and that this would affect their behaviors In the late 19th century, psychologists familiar with the evolutionary theory of Darwin began seeking an evolutionary description of psychological development; prominent here was the pioneering psychologist G",3
"Stanley Hall, who attempted to correlate ages of childhood with previous ages of humanityJames Mark Baldwin, who wrote essays on topics that included Imitation: A Chapter in the Natural History of Consciousness and Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes, was significantly involved in the theory of developmental psychologySigmund Freud, whose concepts were developmental, significantly affected public perceptions    Theories       Psychosexual development    Sigmund Freud believed that everyone has a conscious, preconscious, and unconscious level of awareness",3
"According to Freud, a conscious level of awareness is aware of the mental processThe preconscious level of awareness involves information that, though not currently part of our thoughts, can be introduced into consciousnessLastly, the unconscious level of awareness includes mental processes that a person is unaware ofHe believed there is tension between the conscious and unconscious because the conscious tries to hold back what the unconscious tries to express",3
"To explain this, he developed three personality structures: id, ego, and superegoThe id, the most primitive of the three, functions according to the pleasure principle: seek pleasure and avoid painThe superego plays the critical and moralizing role, while the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the superego.Based on these developments, he proposed five universal stages of developmentEach is characterized by the erogenous zone, which is the source of the child's psychosexual energy",3
"The first is the oral stage, which occurs between about birth to 12 months of ageDuring the oral stage, the source of the child's psychosexual energy is motivated by the mouthFor example, the baby looks to suck on or bite thingsThe second is the anal stage, from one to three years of ageDuring the anal stage, the child defecates from the anus and is often fascinated with their defecation",3
"The third is the phallic stage, which occurs from three to five years of age (most of a person's personality forms by this age)During the phallic stage, the child is aware of their sexual organsThe fourth is the latency stage, which occurs from age five until pubertyDuring the latency stage, the child's sexual interests are repressedStage five is the genital stage, which takes place from puberty until adulthood",3
"During the genital stage, puberty starts happening    Theories of cognitive development    Jean Piaget, a Swiss theorist, posited that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through hands-on experienceHe suggested that the adult's role in helping the child learn was to provide appropriate materials that the child can interact with and use to constructHe used Socratic questioning to get children to reflect on what they were doing, and he tried to get them to see contradictions in their explanations",3
"Piaget believed that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages, which he described in his theory on cognitive developmentEach stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next stepHe believed that these stages are not separate from one another, but rather that each stage builds on the previous one in a continuous learning processHe proposed four stages: sensorimotor, pre-operational, concrete operational, and formal operational",3
"Though he did not believe these stages occurred at any given age, many studies have determined when these cognitive abilities should take place    Stages of moral development    Piaget claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stagesExpanding on Piaget's work, Lawrence Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime.He suggested three levels of moral reasoning; pre-conventional moral reasoning, conventional moral reasoning, and post-conventional moral reasoning",3
" The pre-conventional moral reasoning is typical of children and is characterized by reasoning that is based on rewards and punishments associated with different courses of actionConventional moral reason occurs during late childhood and early adolescence and is characterized by reasoning based on rules and conventions of societyLastly, post-conventional moral reasoning is a stage during which the individual sees society's rules and conventions as relative and subjective, rather than as authoritative.Kohlberg used the Heinz Dilemma to apply to his stages of moral development",3
"The Heinz Dilemma involves Heinz's wife dying from cancer and Heinz having the dilemma to save his wife by stealing a drugPreconventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality applies to Heinz's situation    Stages of psychosocial development    German-American psychologist Erik Erikson and his collaborator and wife, Joan Erikson, conceptualized eight stages of psychosocial development that they theorized healthy individuals pass through as they develop from infancy to adulthoodAt each stage the person must resolve a challenge, or an existential dilemma",3
" Successful resolution of the dilemma results in the person ingraining a positive virtue, but failure to resolve the fundamental challenge of that stage reinforces negative perceptions of the person or the world around them and the person's personal development is unable to progress The first stage, ""Trust vsMistrust"", takes place in infancyThe positive virtue for the first stage is hope, in the infant learning whom to trust and having hope for a supportive group of people to be there for him/her",3
"The second stage is ""Autonomy vsShame and Doubt"" with the positive virtue being willThis takes place in early childhood when the child learns to become more independent by discovering what they are capable of whereas if the child is overly controlled, feelings of inadequacy are reinforced, which can lead to low self-esteem and doubtThe third stage is ""Initiative vsGuilt."" The virtue of being gained is a sense of purpose",3
"This takes place primarily via playThis is the stage where the child will be curious and have many interactions with other kidsThey will ask many questions as their curiosity growsIf too much guilt is present, the child may have a slower and harder time interacting with their world and other children in itThe fourth stage is ""Industry (competence) vsInferiority""The virtue for this stage is competency and is the result of the child's early experiences in school",3
"This stage is when the child will try to win the approval of others and understand the value of their accomplishmentsThe fifth stage is ""Identity vsRole Confusion""The virtue gained is fidelity and it takes place in adolescenceThis is when the child ideally starts to identify their place in society, particularly in terms of their gender roleThe sixth stage is ""Intimacy vsIsolation"", which happens in young adults and the virtue gained is love",3
"This is when the person starts to share his/her life with someone else intimately and emotionallyNot doing so can reinforce feelings of isolationThe seventh stage is ""Generativity vsStagnation""This happens in adulthood and the virtue gained is careA person becomes stable and starts to give back by raising a family and becoming involved in the communityThe eighth stage is ""Ego Integrity vsDespair""When one grows old, they look back on their life and contemplate their successes and failures",3
" If they resolve this positively, the virtue of wisdom is gainedThis is also the stage when one can gain a sense of closure and accept death without regret or fear    Stages based on the model of hierarchical complexity    Michael Commons enhanced and simplified Bärbel Inhelder and Piaget's developmental theory and offers a standard method of examining the universal pattern of developmentThe Model of Hierarchical Complexity (MHC) is not based on the assessment of domain-specific information, It divides the Order of Hierarchical Complexity of tasks to be addressed from the Stage performance on those tasks",3
 A stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participant's successfully addressesHe expanded Piaget's original eight stage (counting the half stages) to fifteen stagesThe stages are : 0 Calculatory; 1 Sensory & Motor; 2 Circular sensory-motor; 3 Sensory-motor; 4 Nominal; 5 Sentential; 6 Preoperational; 7 Primary; 8 Concrete; 9 Abstract; 10 Formal; 11 Systematic; 12 Metasystematic; 13 Paradigmatic; 14 Cross-paradigmatic; 15 Meta-Cross-paradigmaticThe order of hierarchical complexity of tasks predicts how difficult the performance is with an R ranging from 0.9 to 0.98,3
"In the MHC, there are three main axioms for an order to meet in order for the higher order task to coordinate the next lower order taskAxioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchyThese axioms are: a) defined in terms of tasks at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity task action; b) defined as the higher order task action that organizes two or more less complex actions; that is, the more complex action specifies the way in which the less complex actions combine; c) defined as the lower order task actions have to be carried out non-arbitrarily",3
"    Ecological systems theory    Ecological systems theory, originally formulated by Urie Bronfenbrenner, specifies four types of nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the systemsThe four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystemEach system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape developmentThe microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and schoolMesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystemExosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role",3
"Macrosystem refers to the cultural values, customs and laws of society.The microsystem is the immediate environment surrounding and influencing the individual (example: school or the home setting)The mesosystem is the combination of two microsystems and how they influence each other (example: sibling relationships at home vspeer relationships at school)The exosystem is the interaction among two or more settings that are indirectly linked (example: a father's job requiring more overtime ends up influencing his daughter's performance in school because he can no longer help with her homework)",3
"The macrosystem is broader taking into account social economic status, culture, beliefs, customs and morals (example: a child from a wealthier family sees a peer from a less wealthy family as inferior for that reason)Lastly, the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition (example: a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life).Since its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory, The Ecology of Human Development, has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments",3
"As a result of this conceptualization of development, these environments—from the family to economic and political structures—have come to be viewed as part of the life course from childhood through to adulthood    Zone of proximal development    Lev Vygotsky was a Russian theorist from the Soviet era, who posited that children learn through hands-on experience and social interactions with members of their culture Unlike Piaget, he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task (called the ""zone of proximal development"") could help children learn new tasks",3
"This adult role is often referred to as the skilled ""master"", whereas the child is considered the learning apprentice through an educational process often termed ""cognitive apprenticeship"" Martin Hill stated that ""The world of reality does not apply to the mind of a child."" This technique is called ""scaffolding"", because it builds upon knowledge children already have with new knowledge that adults can help the child learnVygotsky was strongly focused on the role of culture in determining the child's pattern of development, arguing that development moves from the social level to the individual level",3
"In other words, Vygotsky claimed that psychology should focus on the progress of human consciousness through the relationship of an individual and their environmentHe felt that if scholars continued to disregard this connection, then this disregard would inhibit the full comprehension of the human consciousness    Constructivism    Constructivism is a paradigm in psychology that characterizes learning as a process of actively constructing knowledgeIndividuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting, organizing, and integrating information with other knowledge, often in the context of social interactions",3
" Constructivism can occur in two ways: individual and socialIndividual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others Social constructivism is when individuals construct knowledge through an interaction between the knowledge they bring to a situation and social or cultural exchanges within that content.Jean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist, proposed that learning is an active process because children learn through experience and make mistakes and solve problems",3
"Piaget proposed that learning should be whole by helping students understand that meaning is constructed    Evolutionary developmental psychology    Evolutionary developmental psychology is a research paradigm that applies the basic principles of Darwinian evolution, particularly natural selection, to understand the development of human behavior and cognitionIt involves the study of both the genetic and environmental mechanisms that underlie the development of social and cognitive competencies, as well as the epigenetic (gene-environment interactions) processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions.EDP considers both the reliably developing, species-typical features of ontogeny (developmental adaptations), as well as individual differences in behavior, from an evolutionary perspective",3
"While evolutionary views tend to regard most individual differences as the result of either random genetic noise (evolutionary byproducts) and/or idiosyncrasies (for example, peer groups, education, neighborhoods, and chance encounters) rather than products of natural selection, EDP asserts that natural selection can favor the emergence of individual differences via ""adaptive developmental plasticity""From this perspective, human development follows alternative life-history strategies in response to environmental variability, rather than following one species-typical pattern of development.EDP is closely linked to the theoretical framework of evolutionary psychology (EP), but is also distinct from EP in several domains, including research emphasis (EDP focuses on adaptations of ontogeny, as opposed to adaptations of adulthood) and consideration of proximate ontogenetic and environmental factors (i.e., how development happens) in addition to more ultimate factors (i.e., why development happens), which are the focus of mainstream evolutionary psychology",3
"    Attachment theory    Attachment theory, originally developed by John Bowlby, focuses on the importance of open, intimate, emotionally meaningful relationshipsAttachment is described as a biological system or powerful survival impulse that evolved to ensure the survival of the infantA threatened or stressed child will move toward caregivers who create a sense of physical, emotional, and psychological safety for the individualAttachment feeds on body contact and familiarityLater Mary Ainsworth developed the Strange Situation protocol and the concept of the secure base",3
"This tool has been found to help understand and surveillance attachment, such as the Strange Situation Test and the Adult Attachment Interview Both of which help determine factors to certain attachment styles The Strange Situation Test help finds ""disturbances in attachment"" and whether certain attributes are found to contribute to a certain attachment issueThe Adult Attachment Interview is a tool that is similar to the Strange Situation Test but instead focuses attachment issues found in adults",3
"Both tests have helped many researchers gain more information on the risks and how to identify them.Theorists have proposed four types of attachment styles: secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant, and disorganizedSecure attachment is a healthy attachment between the infant and the caregiverIt is characterized by trustAnxious-avoidant is an insecure attachment between an infant and a caregiverThis is characterized by the infant's indifference toward the caregiverAnxious-resistant is an insecure attachment between the infant and the caregiver characterized by distress from the infant when separated and anger when reunited",3
"Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent.A child can be hindered in its natural tendency to form attachmentsSome babies are raised without the stimulation and attention of a regular caregiver or locked away under conditions of abuse or extreme neglectThe possible short-term effects of this deprivation are anger, despair, detachment, and temporary delay in intellectual developmentLong-term effects include increased aggression, clinging behavior, detachment, psychosomatic disorders, and an increased risk of depression as an adult.Attachment is established in early childhood and attachment continues into adulthood",3
When involved in intimate relationships the way adults are able to handle relationship issues depends on their attachment styles that were formed during their childhoodAn example of secure attachment continuing in adulthood would be when the person feels confident and is able to meet their own needsHaving a secure attachment allows the adult to have a healthy trusting relationshipAn example of anxious attachment during adulthood is when the adult chooses a partner with anxious-avoidant attachment,3
"Having an anxious/ ambivalent attachment style can affect an adult's trust issues in a committed relationshipBy understanding what attachment style an individual formed with their caregiver when they were children, we can better understand their interpersonal relationships as adults    Nature vs nurture   A significant issue in developmental psychology is the relationship between innateness and environmental influence in regard to any particular aspect of developmentThis is often referred to as ""nature and nurture"" or nativism versus empiricism",3
"A nativist account of development would argue that the processes in question are innate, that is, they are specified by the organism's genes.An empiricist perspective would argue that those processes are acquired in interaction with the environmentToday developmental psychologists rarely take such polarized positions with regard to most aspects of development; rather they investigate, among many other things, the relationship between innate and environmental influencesOne of the ways this relationship has been explored in recent years is through the emerging field of evolutionary developmental psychology",3
One area where this innateness debate has been prominently portrayed is in research on language acquisitionA major question in this area is whether or not certain properties of human language are specified genetically or can be acquired through learningThe empiricist position on the issue of language acquisition suggests that the language input provides the necessary information required for learning the structure of language and that infants acquire language through a process of statistical learning,3
"From this perspective, language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development, such as perceptual learningThe nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of languageLinguist Noam Chomsky asserts that, evidenced by the lack of sufficient information in the language input, there is a universal grammar that applies to all human languages and is pre-specified",3
"This has led to the idea that there is a special cognitive module suited for learning language, often called the language acquisition deviceChomsky's critique of the behaviorist model of language acquisition is regarded by many as a key turning point in the decline in the prominence of the theory of behaviorism generallyBut Skinner's conception of ""Verbal Behavior"" has not died, perhaps in part because it has generated successful practical applications",3
"    Continuity vs discontinuity   One of the major discussions in developmental psychology includes whether development is discontinuous or continuousContinuous development is quantifiable and quantitative, whereas discontinuous development is qualitativeQuantitative estimations of development can be measuring the stature of a child, and measuring their memory or consideration span""Particularly dramatic examples of qualitative changes are metamorphoses, such as the emergence of a caterpillar into a butterfly.""Those psychologists who bolster the continuous view of improvement propose that improvement includes slow and progressing changes all through the life span, with behavior within the prior stages of advancement giving the premise of abilities and capacities required for the other stages",3
"""To many, the concept of continuous, quantifiable measurement seems to be the essence of science"".Not all psychologists, be that as it may, concur that advancement could be a continuous processA few see advancement as a discontinuous processThey accept advancement includes unmistakable and partitioned stages with diverse sorts of behavior happening in each organizationThis proposes that the development of certain capacities in each arrange, such as particular feelings or ways of considering, have a definite beginning and finishing point",3
"Be that as it may, there's no correct time at which a capacity abruptly shows up or disappearsAlthough some sorts of considering, feeling or carrying on could seem to seem abruptly, it is more than likely that this has been developing gradually for some time.Stage theories of development rest on the suspicion that development may be a discontinuous process including particular stages which are characterized by subjective contrasts in behaviorThey moreover assume that the structure of the stages isn't variable concurring to each person, in any case, the time of each arrangement may shift separately",3
"Stage theories can be differentiated with ceaseless hypotheses, which set that development is an incremental process    Stability vs change   This issue involves the degree to which one becomes older renditions of their early experience or whether they develop into something different from who they were at an earlier point in developmentIt considers the extent to which early experiences (especially infancy) or later experiences are the key determinants of a person's development",3
"Most lifespan developmentalists recognize that extreme positions are unwiseTherefore, the key to a comprehensive understanding of development at any stage requires the interaction of different factors and not only one    Mathematical models   Developmental psychology is concerned not only with describing the characteristics of psychological change over time but also seeks to explain the principles and internal workings underlying these changesPsychologists have attempted to better understand these factors by using models",3
"A model must simply account for the means by which a process takes placeThis is sometimes done in reference to changes in the brain that may correspond to changes in behavior over the course of the developmentMathematical modeling is useful in developmental psychology for implementing theory in a precise and easy-to-study manner, allowing generation, explanation, integration, and prediction of diverse phenomenaSeveral modeling techniques are applied to development: symbolic, connectionist (neural network), or dynamical systems models",3
"Dynamic systems models illustrate how many different features of a complex system may interact to yield emergent behaviors and abilitiesNonlinear dynamics has been applied to human systems specifically to address issues that require attention to temporality such as life transitions, human development, and behavioral or emotional change over timeNonlinear dynamic systems is currently being explored as a way to explain discrete phenomena of human development such as affect, second language acquisition, and locomotion",3
"    Research areas       Cognitive development    Cognitive development is primarily concerned with the ways that infants and children acquire, develop, and use internal mental capabilities such as: problem-solving, memory, and languageMajor topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisition and the development of perceptual and motor skillsPiaget was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilitiesHis theory suggests that development proceeds through a set of stages from infancy to adulthood and that there is an end point or goal",3
"Other accounts, such as that of Lev Vygotsky, have suggested that development does not progress through stages, but rather that the developmental process that begins at birth and continues until death is too complex for such structure and finalityRather, from this viewpoint, developmental processes proceed more continuouslyThus, development should be analyzed, instead of treated as a product to obtainKWarner Schaie has expanded the study of cognitive development into adulthood",3
" Rather than being stable from adolescence, Schaie sees adults as progressing in the application of their cognitive abilities.Modern cognitive development has integrated the considerations of cognitive psychology and the psychology of individual differences into the interpretation and modeling of developmentSpecifically, the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development showed that the successive levels or stages of cognitive development are associated with increasing processing efficiency and working memory capacityThese increases explain differences between stages, progression to higher stages, and individual differences of children who are the same-age and of the same grade-level",3
"However, other theories have moved away from Piagetian stage theories, and are influenced by accounts of domain-specific information processing, which posit that development is guided by innate evolutionarily-specified and content-specific information processing mechanisms    Social and emotional development    Developmental psychologists who are interested in social development examine how individuals develop social and emotional competenciesFor example, they study how children form friendships, how they understand and deal with emotions, and how identity develops",3
"Research in this area may involve study of the relationship between cognition or cognitive development and social behaviorEmotional regulation or ER refers to an individual's ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contextsIn young children, this modulation is in part controlled externally, by parents and other authority figuresAs children develop, they take on more and more responsibility for their internal stateStudies have shown that the development of ER is affected by the emotional regulation children observe in parents and caretakers, the emotional climate in the home, and the reaction of parents and caretakers to the child's emotions.Music also has an influence on stimulating and enhancing the senses of a child through self-expression.A child's social and emotional development can be disrupted by motor coordination problems, evidenced by the environmental stress hypothesis",3
" The environmental hypothesis explains how children with coordination problems and developmental coordination disorder are exposed to several psychosocial consequences which act as secondary stressors, leading to an increase in internalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety Motor coordination problems affect fine and gross motor movement as well as perceptual-motor skills Secondary stressors commonly identified include the tendency for children with poor motor skills to be less likely to participate in organized play with other children and more likely to feel socially isolated.Social and emotional development focuses on five keys areas: Self-Awareness, Self Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Skills and Responsible Decision Making",3
"    Physical development   Physical development concerns the physical maturation of an individual's body until it reaches the adult statureAlthough physical growth is a highly regular process, all children differ tremendously in the timing of their growth spurtsStudies are being done to analyze how the differences in these timings affect and are related to other variables of developmental psychology such as information processing speedTraditional measures of physical maturity using x-rays are less in practice nowadays, compared to simple measurements of body parts such as height, weight, head circumference, and arm span.A few other studies and practices with physical developmental psychology are the phonological abilities of mature 5- to 11-year-olds, and the controversial hypotheses of left-handers being maturationally delayed compared to right-handers",3
"A study by Eaton, Chipperfield, Ritchot, and Kostiuk in 1996 found in three different samples that there was no difference between right- and left-handers    Memory development   Researchers interested in memory development look at the way our memory develops from childhood and onwardAccording to fuzzy-trace theory, people have two separate memory processes: verbatim and gistThese two traces begin to develop at different times as well as at a different paceChildren as young as four years old have verbatim memory, memory for surface information, which increases up to early adulthood, at which point it begins to decline",3
"On the other hand, our capacity for gist memory, memory for semantic information, increases up to early adulthood, at which point it is consistent through old ageFurthermore, one's reliance on gist memory traces increases as one ages    Research methods and designs       Main research methods   Developmental psychology employs many of the research methods used in other areas of psychologyHowever, infants and children cannot be tested in the same ways as adults, so different methods are often used to study their development",3
"Developmental psychologists have a number of methods to study changes in individuals over timeCommon research methods include systematic observation, including naturalistic observation or structured observation; self-reports, which could be clinical interviews or structured interviews; clinical or case study method; and ethnography or participant observation.: 31–35  These methods differ in the extent of control researchers impose on study conditions, and how they construct ideas about which variables to studyEvery developmental investigation can be characterized in terms of whether its underlying strategy involves the experimental, correlational, or case study approach",3
"The experimental method involves ""actual manipulation of various treatments, circumstances, or events to which the participant or subject is exposed; the experimental design points to cause-and-effect relationshipsThis method allows for strong inferences to be made of causal relationships between the manipulation of one or more independent variables and subsequent behavior, as measured by the dependent variableThe advantage of using this research method is that it permits determination of cause-and-effect relationships among variables",3
"On the other hand, the limitation is that data obtained in an artificial environment may lack generalizabilityThe correlational method explores the relationship between two or more events by gathering information about these variables without researcher interventionThe advantage of using a correlational design is that it estimates the strength and direction of relationships among variables in the natural environment; however, the limitation is that it does not permit determination of cause-and-effect relationships among variables",3
"The case study approach allows investigations to obtain an in-depth understanding of an individual participant by collecting data based on interviews, structured questionnaires, observations, and test scoresEach of these methods have its strengths and weaknesses but the experimental method when appropriate is the preferred method of developmental scientists because it provides a controlled situation and conclusions to be drawn about cause-and-effect relationships    Research designs   Most developmental studies, regardless of whether they employ the experimental, correlational, or case study method, can also be constructed using research designs",3
"Research designs are logical frameworks used to make key comparisons within research studies such as:  cross-sectional design longitudinal design sequential design microgenetic designIn a longitudinal study, a researcher observes many individuals born at or around the same time (a cohort) and carries out new observations as members of the cohort ageThis method can be used to draw conclusions about which types of development are universal (or normative) and occur in most members of a cohort",3
"As an example a longitudinal study of early literacy development examined in detail the early literacy experiences of one child in each of 30 families.Researchers may also observe ways that development varies between individuals, and hypothesize about the causes of variation in their dataLongitudinal studies often require large amounts of time and funding, making them unfeasible in some situationsAlso, because members of a cohort all experience historical events unique to their generation, apparently normative developmental trends may, in fact, be universal only to their cohort.: 40 In a cross-sectional study, a researcher observes differences between individuals of different ages at the same time",3
"This generally requires fewer resources than the longitudinal method, and because the individuals come from different cohorts, shared historical events are not so much of a confounding factorBy the same token, however, cross-sectional research may not be the most effective way to study differences between participants, as these differences may result not from their different ages but from their exposure to different historical events.: 41 A third study design, the sequential design, combines both methodologies",3
"Here, a researcher observes members of different birth cohorts at the same time, and then tracks all participants over time, charting changes in the groupsWhile much more resource-intensive, the format aids in a clearer distinction between what changes can be attributed to an individual or historical environment from those that are truly universal.: 42 Because every method has some weaknesses, developmental psychologists rarely rely on one study or even one method to reach conclusions by finding consistent evidence from as many converging sources as possible",3
"    Life stages of psychological development       Prenatal development    Prenatal development is of interest to psychologists investigating the context of early psychological developmentThe whole prenatal development involves three main stages: germinal stage, embryonic stage and fetal stageGerminal stage begins at conception until 2 weeks; embryonic stage means the development from 2 weeks to 8 weeks; fetal stage represents 9 weeks until birth of the babyThe senses develop in the womb itself: a fetus can both see and hear by the second trimester (13 to 24 weeks of age)",3
"The sense of touch develops in the embryonic stage (5 to 8 weeks).: 97  Most of the brain's billions of neurons also are developed by the second trimester.: 100  Babies are hence born with some odor, taste and sound preferences, largely related to the mother's environment.: 101 Some primitive reflexes too arise before birth and are still present in newbornsOne hypothesis is that these reflexes are vestigial and have limited use in early human life",3
"Piaget's theory of cognitive development suggested that some early reflexes are building blocks for infant sensorimotor developmentFor example, the tonic neck reflex may help development by bringing objects into the infant's field of view.Other reflexes, such as the walking reflex, appear to be replaced by more sophisticated voluntary control later in infancyThis may be because the infant gains too much weight after birth to be strong enough to use the reflex, or because the reflex and subsequent development are functionally different",3
"It has also been suggested that some reflexes (for example the moro and walking reflexes) are predominantly adaptations to life in the womb with little connection to early infant development Primitive reflexes reappear in adults under certain conditions, such as neurological conditions like dementia or traumatic lesionsUltrasound has shown that infants are capable of a range of movements in the womb, many of which appear to be more than simple reflexes",3
"By the time they are born, infants can recognize and have a preference for their mother's voice suggesting some prenatal development of auditory perceptionPrenatal development and birth complications may also be connected to neurodevelopmental disorders, for example in schizophreniaWith the advent of cognitive neuroscience, embryology and the neuroscience of prenatal development is of increasing interest to developmental psychology researchSeveral environmental agents—teratogens—can cause damage during the prenatal periodThese include prescription and nonprescription drugs, illegal drugs, tobacco, alcohol, environmental pollutants, infectious disease agents such as the rubella virus and the toxoplasmosis parasite, maternal malnutrition, maternal emotional stress, and Rh factor blood incompatibility between mother and child.: 102–115  There are many statistics which prove the effects of the aforementioned substances",3
"A leading example of this would be that, in America alone, approximately 100,000-375,000 'cocaine babies' are born on an annual basisThis is a result of an expectant mother abusing the drug while pregnant'Cocaine babies' are proven to have quite severe and lasting difficulties which persist throughout infancy and right throughout childhoodThe drug also encourages behavioural problems in the affected children and defects of various vital organs    Infancy    From birth until the first year, the child is referred to as an infant",3
"Developmental psychologists vary widely in their assessment of infant psychology, and the influence the outside world has upon it, but certain aspects are relatively clearThe majority of a newborn infant's time is spent in sleepAt first, this sleep is evenly spread throughout the day and night, but after a couple of months, infants generally become diurnalInfants can be seen to have six states, grouped into pairs:  quiet sleep and active sleep (dreaming, when REM sleep occurs) quiet waking, and active waking fussing and crying      Infant perception    Infant perception is what a newborn can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch",3
" These five features are better known as one's ""five senses""Infants respond to stimuli differently in these different statesVision is significantly worse in infants than in older childrenInfant sight tends to be blurry in early stages but improves over timeColor perception similar to that seen in adults has been demonstrated in infants as young as four months, using habituation methodsInfants attain adult-like vision in about six months.: 191  Hearing is well-developed prior to birth, unlike vision",3
"Newborns prefer complex sounds to pure tones, human speech to other sounds, mother's voice to other voices, and the native language to other languagesScientist believe these features are probably learned in the womb.: 151  Infants are fairly good at detecting the direction a sound comes from, and by 18 months their hearing ability is approximately equal to an adult'sSmell and taste are present, with infants showing different expressions of disgust or pleasure when presented with pleasant odors (honey, milk, etc.) or unpleasant odors (rotten egg) and tastes (e.g",3
"sour taste)Newborns are born with odor and taste preferences acquired in the womb from the smell and taste of amniotic fluid, in turn influenced by what the mother eatsBoth breast- and bottle-fed babies around three days old prefer the smell of human milk to that of formula, indicating an innate preference.: 150  There is good evidence for older infants preferring the smell of their mother to that of othersTouch and feel is one of the better-developed senses at birth as it is one of the first senses to develop inside the womb",3
" This is evidenced by the primitive reflexes described above, and the relatively advanced development of the somatosensory cortexPain: Infants feel pain similarly, if not more strongly than older children, but pain relief in infants has not received so much attention as an area of researchGlucose is known to relieve pain in newborns     Language     Babies are born with the ability to discriminate virtually all sounds of all human languages.: 189  Infants of around six months can differentiate between phonemes in their own language, but not between similar phonemes in another language",3
"At this stage infants also start to babble, producing phonemes     Infant cognition: the Piagetian era    Piaget suggested that an infant's perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor development, which was required for the infant to link visual, tactile and motor representations of objectsAccording to this view, it is through touching and handling objects that infants develop object permanence, the understanding that objects are solid and permanent and continue to exist when out of sight.Piaget's sensorimotor stage comprised six sub-stages (see sensorimotor stages for more detail)",3
"In the early stages, development arises out of movements caused by primitive reflexesDiscovery of new behaviors results from classical and operant conditioning, and the formation of habitsFrom eight months the infant is able to uncover a hidden object but will persevere when the object is movedPiaget came to his conclusion that infants lacked a complete understanding of object permanence before 18 months after observing infants' failure before this age to look for an object where it was last seen",3
"Instead, infants continue to look for an object where it was first seen, committing the ""A-not-B error""Some researchers have suggested that before the age of eight to nine months, infants' inability to understand object permanence extends to people, which explains why infants at this age do not cry when their mothers are gone (""Out of sight, out of mind"")     Recent findings in infant cognition    In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers have developed many new methods of assessing infants' understanding of the world with far more precision and subtlety than Piaget was able to do in his time",3
"Since then, many studies based on these methods suggest that young infants understand far more about the world than first thoughtBased on recent findings, some researchers (such as Elizabeth Spelke and Renee Baillargeon) have proposed that an understanding of object permanence is not learned at all, but rather comprises part of the innate cognitive capacities of our speciesOther research has suggested that young infants in their first six months of life may possess an understanding of numerous aspects of the world around them, including:  an early numerical cognition, that is, an ability to represent number and even compute the outcomes of addition and subtraction operations; an ability to infer the goals of people in their environment; an ability to engage in simple causal reasoning",3
"     Critical periods of development    There are critical periods in infancy and childhood during which development of certain perceptual, sensorimotor, social and language systems depends crucially on environmental stimulationFeral children such as Genie, deprived of adequate stimulation, fail to acquire important skills and are unable to learn in later childhoodThe concept of critical periods is also well-established in neurophysiology, from the work of Hubel and Wiesel among others     Developmental delays    Studies have been done to look at the differences in children who have developmental delays versus typical development",3
"Normally when being compared to one another, mental age (MA) is not taken into considerationThere still may be differences in developmentally delayed (DD) children vstypical development (TD) behavioral, emotional and other mental disordersWhen compared to MA children there is a bigger difference between normal developmental behaviors overallDDs can cause lower MA, so comparing DDs with TDs may not be as accuratePairing DDs specifically with TD children at similar MA can be more accurate",3
"There are levels of behavioral differences that are considered as normal at certain agesWhen we look at DDs and MA kids, we want to see if those with DDs have a larger amount of behavior that is not normal for their MA groupDevelopmental delays tend to contribute to other disorders or difficulties than their TD counterparts    Toddlerhood    Infants shift between ages of one and two to a developmental stage known as toddlerhood",3
"In this stage, an infant's transition into toddlerhood is highlighted through self-awareness, developing maturity in language use, and presence of memory and imaginationDuring toddlerhood, babies begin learning how to walk, talk, and make decisions for themselvesAn important characteristic of this age period is the development of language, where children are learning how to communicate and express their emotions and desires through the use of vocal sounds, babbling, and eventually words",3
"Self-control also begins to developAt this age, children take initiative to explore, experiment and learn from making mistakesCaretakers who encourage toddlers to try new things and test their limits, help the child become autonomous, self-reliant, and confidentIf the caretaker is overprotective or disapproving of independent actions, the toddler may begin to doubt their abilities and feel ashamed of the desire for independenceThe child's autonomic development is inhibited, leaving them less prepared to deal with the world in the future",3
"Toddlers also begin to identify themselves in gender roles, acting according to their perception of what a man or woman should do.Socially, the period of toddler-hood is commonly called the ""terrible twos""Toddlers often use their new-found language abilities to voice their desires, but are often misunderstood by parents due to their language skills just beginning to develop A person at this stage testing their independence is another reason behind the stage's infamous label",3
"Tantrums in a fit of frustration are also common    Childhood    Erik Erikson divides childhood into four stages, each with its distinct social crisis: Stage 1: Infancy (0 to 1½) in which the psychosocial crisis is Trust vsMistrust Stage 2: Early childhood (2½ to 3) in which the psychosocial crisis is Autonomy vsShame and doubt Stage 3: Play age (3 to 5) in which the psychosocial crisis is Initiative vsGuilt",3
"(This stage is also called the ""pre-school age"", ""exploratory age"" and ""toy age"".) Stage 4: School age (5 to 12) in which the psychosocial crisis is Industry vsInferiorityPlay (or preschool) ages 3–5In the earliest years, children are ""completely dependent on the care of others""Therefore, they develop a ""social relationship"" with their care givers and, later, with family membersDuring their preschool years (3-5), they ""enlarge their social horizons"" to include people outside the family.Preoperational and then operational thinking develops, which means actions are reversible, and egocentric thought diminishes.The motor skills of preschoolers increase so they can do more things for themselves",3
"They become more independentNo longer completely dependent on the care of others, the world of this age group expandsMore people have a role in shaping their individual personalitiesPreschoolers explore and question their worldFor Jean Piaget, the child is ""a little scientist exploring and reflecting on these explorations to increase competence"" and this is done in ""a very independent way"".: 7, 9 Play is a major activity for ages 3–5",3
"For Piaget, through play ""a child reaches higher levels of cognitive development."": 14 In their expanded world, children in the 3–5 age group attempt to find their own wayIf this is done in a socially acceptable way, the child develops the initiativeIf not, the child develops guiltChildren who develop ""guilt"" rather than ""initiative"" have failed Erikson's psychosocial crisis for the 3–5 age groupMiddle childhood ages 6–12For Erik Erikson, the psychosocial crisis during middle childhood is Industry vs",3
"Inferiority which, if successfully met, instills a sense of Competency in the child.In all cultures, middle childhood is a time for developing ""skills that will be needed in their society."" School offers an arena in which children can gain a view of themselves as ""industrious (and worthy)""They are ""graded for their school work and often for their industry""They can also develop industry outside of school in sports, games, and doing volunteer work",3
"Children who achieve ""success in school or games might develop a feeling of competence."" The ""peril during this period is that feelings of inadequacy and inferiority will developParents and teachers can ""undermine"" a child's development by failing to recognize accomplishments or being overly critical of a child's effortsChildren who are ""encouraged and praised"" develop a belief in their competenceLack of encouragement or ability to excel lead to ""feelings of inadequacy and inferiority"".The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) divides Middle Childhood into two stages, 6–8 years and 9–11 years, and gives ""developmental milestones for each stage"".Middle Childhood (7–10)",3
"Entering elementary school, children in this age group begin to thinks about the future and their ""place in the world""Working with other students and wanting their friendship and acceptance become more importantThis leads to ""more independence from parents and family""As students, they develop the mental and verbal skills ""to describe experiences and talk about thoughts and feelings""They become less self-centered and show ""more concern for others"".Middle Childhood (9–11)",3
"For children ages 9–11 ""friendships and peer relationships"" increase in strength, complexity, and importanceThis results in greater ""peer pressure""They grow even less dependent on their families and they are challenged academicallyTo meet this challenge, they increase their attention span and learn to see other points of view    Adolescence    Adolescence is the period of life between the onset of puberty and the full commitment to an adult social role, such as worker, parent, and/or citizen",3
"It is the period known for the formation of personal and social identity (see Erik Erikson) and the discovery of moral purpose (see William Damon)Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts and formal reasoningA return to egocentric thought often occurs early in the periodOnly 35% develop the capacity to reason formally during adolescence or adulthood(Huitt, Wand Hummel, JJanuary 1998)It is divided into three parts, namely:  Early Adolescence: 9 to 13 years Mid Adolescence: 13 to 15 years and Late Adolescence: 15 to 18 yearsThe adolescent unconsciously explores questions such as ""Who am I? Who do I want to be?"" Like toddlers, adolescents must explore, test limits, become autonomous, and commit to an identity, or sense of self",3
"Different roles, behaviors and ideologies must be tried out to select an identityRole confusion and inability to choose vocation can result from a failure to achieve a sense of identity through, for example, friends    Early adulthood    Early adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 18 to 29, and according to theorists such as Erik Erikson, is a stage where development is mainly focused on maintaining relationships Examples include creating bond of intimacy, sustaining friendships, and starting a family",3
"Some theorists state that development of intimacy skills rely on the resolution of previous developmental stagesA sense of identity gained in the previous stages is also necessary for intimacy to developIf this skill is not learned the alternative is alienation, isolation, a fear of commitment, and the inability to depend on othersA related framework for studying this part of the lifespan is that of emerging adulthoodScholars of emerging adulthood, such as Jeffrey Arnett, are not necessarily interested in relationship development",3
"Instead, this concept suggests that people transition after their teenage years into a period not characterized as relationship building and an overall sense of constancy with life, but with years of living with parents, phases of self-discovery, and experimentation    Middle adulthood    Middle adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 29 to 49During this period, middle-aged adults experience a conflict between generativity and stagnationThey may either feel a sense of contributing to society, the next generation, or their immediate community; or develop a sense of purposelessness",3
"Physically, the middle-aged experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, sensory keenness, and cardiac outputAlso, women experience menopause at an average age of 48.8 and a sharp drop in the hormone estrogenMen experience an equivalent endocrine system event to menopauseAndropause in males is a hormone fluctuation with physical and psychological effects that can be similar to those seen in menopausal femalesAs men age lowered testosterone levels can contribute to mood swings and a decline in sperm count",3
"Sexual responsiveness can also be affected, including delays in erection and longer periods of penile stimulation required to achieve ejaculationThe important influence of biological and social changes experienced by women and men in middle adulthood is reflected in that fact that depression is highest at age 48.5 around the world    Old age    The World Health Organization finds ""no general agreement on the age at which a person becomes old."" Most ""developed countries"" set the age as 60 or 65",3
"However, in developing countries inability to make ""active contribution"" to society, not chronological age, marks the beginning of old ageAccording to Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, old age is the stage in which individuals assess the quality of their livesIn reflecting on their lives, people in this age group develop a feeling of integrity if deciding that their lives were successful or a feeling of despair if evaluation of one's life indicates a failure to achieve goals.Physically, older people experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, stamina, hearing, distance perception, and the sense of smell",3
"They also are more susceptible to diseases such as cancer and pneumonia due to a weakened immune systemPrograms aimed at balance, muscle strength, and mobility have been shown to reduce disability among mildly (but not more severely) disabled elderly.Sexual expression depends in large part upon the emotional and physical health of the individualMany older adults continue to be sexually active and satisfied with their sexual activity.Mental disintegration may also occur, leading to dementia or ailments such as Alzheimer's disease",3
"The average age of onset for dementia in males is 78.8 and 81.9 for womenIt is generally believed that crystallized intelligence increases up to old age, while fluid intelligence decreases with ageWhether or not normal intelligence increases or decreases with age depends on the measure and studyLongitudinal studies show that perceptual speed, inductive reasoning, and spatial orientation declineAn article on adult cognitive development reports that cross-sectional studies show that ""some abilities remained stable into early old age""",3
"    Parenting   Parenting variables alone have typically accounted for 20 to 50 percent of the variance in child outcomes.All parents have their own parenting stylesParenting styles, according to Kimberly Kopko, are ""based upon two aspects of parenting behavior; control and warmthParental control refers to the degree to which parents manage their children's behaviorParental warmth refers to the degree to which parents are accepting and responsive to their children's behavior.""     Parenting styles   The following parenting styles have been described in the child development literature:  Authoritative parenting is characterized as parents who have high parental warmth, responsiveness, and demandingness, but rate low in negativity and conflict",3
"These parents are assertive but not intrusive or overly restrictive This method of parenting is associated with more positive social and academic outcomesThe beneficial outcomes of authoritative parenting are not necessarily universalAmong African American adolescents, authoritative parenting is not associated with academic achievement without peer support for achievementChildren who are raised by authoritative parents are ""more likely to become independent, self-reliant, socially accepted, academically successful, and well-behavedThey are less likely to report depression and anxiety, and less likely to engage in antisocial behavior like delinquency and drug use."" Authoritarian parenting is characterized by low levels of warmth and responsiveness with high levels of demandingness and firm control",3
"These parents focus on obedience and they monitor their children regularlyIn general, this style of parenting is associated with maladaptive outcomes The outcomes are more harmful for middle-class boys than girls, preschool white girls than preschool black girls, and for white boys than Hispanic boysPermissive parenting is characterized by high levels of responsiveness combined with low levels of demandingnessThese parents are lenient and do not necessarily require mature behavior",3
" They allow for a high degree of self-regulation and typically avoid confrontation Compared to children raised using the authoritative style, preschool girls raised in permissive families are less assertive Additionally, preschool children of both sexes are less cognitively competent than those children raised under authoritative parenting stylesRejecting or neglectful parenting is the final categoryThis is characterized by low levels of demandingness and responsivenessThese parents are typically disengaged in their child's lives, lacking structure in their parenting styles and are unsupportive",3
" Children in this category are typically the least competent of all the categories    Mother and father factors   Parenting roles in child development have typically focused on the role of the motherRecent literature, however, has looked toward the father as having an important role in child development Affirming a role for fathers, studies have shown that children as young as 15 months benefit significantly from substantial engagement with their fatherIn particular, a study in the U.S",3
"and New Zealand found the presence of the natural father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls Furthermore, another argument is that neither a mother nor a father is actually essential in successful parenting, and that single parents as well as homosexual couples can support positive child outcomesAccording to this set of research, children need at least one consistently responsible adult with whom the child can have a positive emotional connection",3
"Having more than one of these figures contributes to a higher likelihood of positive child outcomes    Divorce   Another parental factor often debated in terms of its effects on child development is divorce Divorce in itself is not a determining factor of negative child outcomesIn fact, the majority of children from divorcing families fall into the normal range on measures of psychological and cognitive functioningA number of mediating factors play a role in determining the effects divorce has on a child, for example, divorcing families with young children often face harsher consequences in terms of demographic, social, and economic changes than do families with older children",3
"Positive coparenting after divorce is part of a pattern associated with positive child coping, while hostile parenting behaviors lead to a destructive pattern leaving children at riskAdditionally, direct parental relationship with the child also affects the development of a child after a divorce Overall, protective factors facilitating positive child development after a divorce are maternal warmth, positive father-child relationship, and cooperation between parents    See also       Journals       References       Further reading       External links    Media related to Developmental psychology at Wikimedia Commons The Society for Research in Child Development The British Psychological Society, Developmental Psychology Section Developmental Psychology: lessons for teaching and learning developmental psychology GMU's On-Line Resources for Developmental Psychology: a web directory of developmental psychology organizations Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, History (HEARTH)An e-book collection of over 1,000 books spanning 1850 to 1950, created by Cornell University's Mann Library",3
"Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspectiveIt seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations – that is, the functional products of natural selection or sexual selection in human evolutionAdaptationist thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common in evolutionary biologySome evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking to psychology, arguing that the modularity of mind is similar to that of the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions",3
"These evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.Evolutionary psychology is not simply a subdiscipline of psychology—its evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, metatheoretical framework that integrates the entire field of psychology in the same way evolutionary biology has for biology.Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations including the abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others",3
"Findings have been made regarding human social behaviour related to infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price, and parental investment The theories and findings of evolutionary psychology have applications in many fields, including economics, environment, health, law, management, psychiatry, politics, and literature.Criticism of evolutionary psychology involves questions of testability, cognitive and evolutionary assumptions (such as modular functioning of the brain, and large uncertainty about the ancestral environment), importance of non-genetic and non-adaptive explanations, as well as political and ethical issues due to interpretations of research results",3
"    Scope       Principles   Evolutionary psychology is an approach that views human nature as the product of a universal set of evolved psychological adaptations to recurring problems in the ancestral environmentProponents suggest that it seeks to integrate psychology into the other natural sciences, rooting it in the organizing theory of biology (evolutionary theory), and thus understanding psychology as a branch of biologyAnthropologist John Tooby and psychologist Leda Cosmides note:  Evolutionary psychology is the long-forestalled scientific attempt to assemble out of the disjointed, fragmentary, and mutually contradictory human disciplines a single, logically integrated research framework for the psychological, social, and behavioral sciences – a framework that not only incorporates the evolutionary sciences on a full and equal basis, but that systematically works out all of the revisions in existing belief and research practice that such a synthesis requires",3
"Just as human physiology and evolutionary physiology have worked to identify physical adaptations of the body that represent ""human physiological nature,"" the purpose of evolutionary psychology is to identify evolved emotional and cognitive adaptations that represent ""human psychological nature."" According to Steven Pinker, it is ""not a single theory but a large set of hypotheses"" and a term that ""has also come to refer to a particular way of applying evolutionary theory to the mind, with an emphasis on adaptation, gene-level selection, and modularity."" Evolutionary psychology adopts an understanding of the mind that is based on the computational theory of mind",3
"It describes mental processes as computational operations, so that, for example, a fear response is described as arising from a neurological computation that inputs the perceptional data, e.ga visual image of a spider, and outputs the appropriate reaction, e.gfear of possibly dangerous animalsUnder this view, any domain-general learning is impossible because of the combinatorial explosionEvolutionary Psychology specifies the domain as the problems of survival and reproduction.While philosophers have generally considered the human mind to include broad faculties, such as reason and lust, evolutionary psychologists describe evolved psychological mechanisms as narrowly focused to deal with specific issues, such as catching cheaters or choosing mates",3
"The discipline views the human brain as comprising many functional mechanisms called psychological adaptations or evolved cognitive mechanisms or cognitive modules, designed by the process of natural selectionExamples include language-acquisition modules, incest-avoidance mechanisms, cheater-detection mechanisms, intelligence and sex-specific mating preferences, foraging mechanisms, alliance-tracking mechanisms, agent-detection mechanisms, and othersSome mechanisms, termed domain-specific, deal with recurrent adaptive problems over the course of human evolutionary historyDomain-general mechanisms, on the other hand, are proposed to deal with evolutionary novelty.Evolutionary psychology has roots in cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology but also draws on behavioral ecology, artificial intelligence, genetics, ethology, anthropology, archaeology, biology, and zoology",3
"It is closely linked to sociobiology, but there are key differences between them including the emphasis on domain-specific rather than domain-general mechanisms, the relevance of measures of current fitness, the importance of mismatch theory, and psychology rather than behaviorNikolaas Tinbergen's four categories of questions can help to clarify the distinctions between several different, but complementary, types of explanationsEvolutionary psychology focuses primarily on the ""why?"" questions, while traditional psychology focuses on the ""how?"" questions",3
"    Premises   Evolutionary psychology is founded on several core premises The brain is an information processing device, and it produces behavior in response to external and internal inputsThe brain's adaptive mechanisms were shaped by natural and sexual selectionDifferent neural mechanisms are specialized for solving problems in humanity's evolutionary pastThe brain has evolved specialized neural mechanisms that were designed for solving problems that recurred over deep evolutionary time, giving modern humans stone-age minds",3
"Most contents and processes of the brain are unconscious; and most mental problems that seem easy to solve are actually extremely difficult problems that are solved unconsciously by complicated neural mechanismsHuman psychology consists of many specialized mechanisms, each sensitive to different classes of information or inputsThese mechanisms combine to produce manifest behavior    History    Evolutionary psychology has its historical roots in Charles Darwin's theory of natural selectionIn The Origin of Species, Darwin predicted that psychology would develop an evolutionary basis:  In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches",3
"Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradationTwo of his later books were devoted to the study of animal emotions and psychology; The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871 and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals in 1872Darwin's work inspired William James's functionalist approach to psychologyDarwin's theories of evolution, adaptation, and natural selection have provided insight into why brains function the way they do.The content of evolutionary psychology has derived from, on the one hand, the biological sciences (especially evolutionary theory as it relates to ancient human environments, the study of paleoanthropology and animal behavior) and, on the other, the human sciences, especially psychology",3
Evolutionary biology as an academic discipline emerged with the modern synthesis in the 1930s and 1940sIn the 1930s the study of animal behavior (ethology) emerged with the work of the Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and the Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von FrischW.DHamilton's (1964) papers on inclusive fitness and Robert Trivers's (1972) theories on reciprocity and parental investment helped to establish evolutionary thinking in psychology and the other social sciences,3
"In 1975, Edward OWilson combined evolutionary theory with studies of animal and social behavior, building on the works of Lorenz and Tinbergen, in his book Sociobiology: The New SynthesisIn the 1970s, two major branches developed from ethologyFirstly, the study of animal social behavior (including humans) generated sociobiology, defined by its pre-eminent proponent Edward OWilson in 1975 as ""the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior"" and in 1978 as ""the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization."" Secondly, there was behavioral ecology which placed less emphasis on social behavior; it focused on the ecological and evolutionary basis of animal and human behavior",3
"In the 1970s and 1980s university departments began to include the term evolutionary biology in their titlesThe modern era of evolutionary psychology was ushered in, in particular, by Donald Symons' 1979 book The Evolution of Human Sexuality and Leda Cosmides and John Tooby's 1992 book The Adapted MindDavid Buller observed that the term ""evolutionary psychology"" is sometimes seen as denoting research based on the specific methodological and theoretical commitments of certain researchers from the Santa Barbara school (University of California), thus some evolutionary psychologists prefer to term their work ""human ecology"", ""human behavioural ecology"" or ""evolutionary anthropology"" instead.From psychology there are the primary streams of developmental, social and cognitive psychology",3
"Establishing some measure of the relative influence of genetics and environment on behavior has been at the core of behavioral genetics and its variants, notably studies at the molecular level that examine the relationship between genes, neurotransmitters and behaviorDual inheritance theory (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has a slightly different perspective by trying to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution",3
"DIT is seen by some as a ""middle-ground"" between views that emphasize human universals versus those that emphasize cultural variation    Theoretical foundations    The theories on which evolutionary psychology is based originated with Charles Darwin's work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humansModern evolutionary psychology, however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th centuryEvolutionary psychologists say that natural selection has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations",3
"As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptednessSexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to matingFor male mammals, which have a relatively high maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for femalesFor female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates",3
"Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of altruistic (self-sacrificing) behaviorBut group selection was considered a weak explanation, because in any group the less altruistic individuals will be more likely to survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a wholeIn 1964, William DHamilton proposed inclusive fitness theory, emphasizing a gene-centered view of evolutionHamilton noted that genes can increase the replication of copies of themselves into the next generation by influencing the organism's social traits in such a way that (statistically) results in helping the survival and reproduction of other copies of the same genes (most simply, identical copies in the organism's close relatives)",3
"According to Hamilton's rule, self-sacrificing behaviors (and the genes influencing them) can evolve if they typically help the organism's close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrificeInclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how altruism can evolveOther theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including evolutionary game theory, tit-for-tat reciprocity, and generalized reciprocityThese theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology",3
"The r/K selection theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each oneHumans follow the second strategyParental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitnessAccording to the Trivers–Willard hypothesis, parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions)",3
"According to life history theory, animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspringDual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture, and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the Baldwin effect)    Evolved psychological mechanisms    Evolutionary psychology is based on the hypothesis that, just like hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys, and immune systems, cognition has a functional structure that has a genetic basis, and therefore has evolved by natural selection",3
"Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst a species and should solve important problems of survival and reproductionEvolutionary psychologists seek to understand psychological mechanisms by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might have served over the course of evolutionary historyThese might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leadersConsistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives",3
"For instance, a mother may wish to wean her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspringEvolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruismLike chimpanzees and bonobos, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliancesIn studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment",3
"    Historical topics   Proponents of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s made some explorations in historical events, but the response from historical experts was highly negative and there has been little effort to continue that line of researchHistorian Lynn Hunt says that the historians complained that the researchers:  have read the wrong studies, misinterpreted the results of experiments, or worse yet, turned to neuroscience looking for a universalizing, anti-representational and anti-intentional ontology to bolster their claims",3
"Hunt states that ""the few attempts to build up a subfield of psychohistory collapsed under the weight of its presuppositions."" She concludes that as of 2014 the ""'iron curtain' between historians and psychology...remains standing.""     Products of evolution: adaptations, exaptations, byproducts, and random variation   Not all traits of organisms are evolutionary adaptationsAs noted in the table below, traits may also be exaptations, byproducts of adaptations (sometimes called ""spandrels""), or random variation between individuals.Psychological adaptations are hypothesized to be innate or relatively easy to learn and to manifest in cultures worldwide",3
"For example, the ability of toddlers to learn a language with virtually no training is likely to be a psychological adaptationOn the other hand, ancestral humans did not read or write, thus today, learning to read and write requires extensive training, and presumably involves the repurposing of cognitive capacities that evolved in response to selection pressures unrelated to written languageHowever, variations in manifest behavior can result from universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments",3
"For example, Caucasians who move from a northern climate to the equator will have darker skinThe mechanisms regulating their pigmentation do not change; rather the input to those mechanisms change, resulting in different outputs One of the tasks of evolutionary psychology is to identify which psychological traits are likely to be adaptations, byproducts or random variationGeorge CWilliams suggested that an ""adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary."" As noted by Williams and others, adaptations can be identified by their improbable complexity, species universality, and adaptive functionality",3
"    Obligate and facultative adaptations   A question that may be asked about an adaptation is whether it is generally obligate (relatively robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation)The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operationBy contrast, facultative adaptations are somewhat like ""if-then"" statements",3
"For example, adult attachment style seems particularly sensitive to early childhood experiencesAs adults, the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others is dependent on whether early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attentionThe adaptation for skin to tan is conditional to exposure to sunlight; this is an example of another facultative adaptationWhen a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation",3
"    Cultural universals    Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptationsCultural universals include behaviors related to language, cognition, social roles, gender roles, and technologyEvolved psychological adaptations (such as the ability to learn a language) interact with cultural inputs to produce specific behaviors (e.g., the specific language learned)Basic gender differences, such as greater eagerness for sex among men and greater coyness among women, are explained as sexually dimorphic psychological adaptations that reflect the different reproductive strategies of males and females.Evolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the ""standard social science model,"" according to which the mind is a general-purpose cognition device shaped almost entirely by culture",3
"    Environment of evolutionary adaptedness    Evolutionary psychology argues that to properly understand the functions of the brain, one must understand the properties of the environment in which the brain evolvedThat environment is often referred to as the ""environment of evolutionary adaptedness"".The idea of an environment of evolutionary adaptedness was first explored as a part of attachment theory by John BowlbyThis is the environment to which a particular evolved mechanism is adapted",3
"More specifically, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness is defined as the set of historically recurring selection pressures that formed a given adaptation, as well as those aspects of the environment that were necessary for the proper development and functioning of the adaptationHumans, comprising the genus Homo, appeared between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago, a time that roughly coincides with the start of the Pleistocene 2.6 million years agoBecause the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by stabilizing selection during the Pleistocene",3
"Evolutionary psychology, therefore, proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to reproductive problems frequently encountered in Pleistocene environmentsIn broad terms, these problems include those of growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and social relationshipsThe environment of evolutionary adaptedness is significantly different from modern societyThe ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning",3
"Researchers look to existing hunter-gatherer societies for clues as to how hunter-gatherers lived in the environment of evolutionary adaptednessUnfortunately, the few surviving hunter-gatherer societies are different from each other, and they have been pushed out of the best land and into harsh environments, so it is not clear how closely they reflect ancestral cultureHowever, all around the world small-band hunter-gatherers offer a similar developmental system for the young (""hunter-gatherer childhood model,"" Konner, 2005;  ""evolved developmental niche"" or ""evolved nest;"" Narvaez et al., 2013)",3
"The characteristics of the niche are largely the same as for social mammals, who evolved over 30 million years ago: soothing perinatal experience, several years of on-request breastfeeding, nearly constant affection or physical proximity, responsiveness to need (mitigating offspring distress), self-directed play, and for humans, multiple responsive caregiversInitial studies show the importance of these components in early life for positive child outcomes.Evolutionary psychologists sometimes look to chimpanzees, bonobos, and other great apes for insight into human ancestral behavior",3
"    Mismatches    Since an organism's adaptations were suited to its ancestral environment, a new and different environment can create a mismatchBecause humans are mostly adapted to Pleistocene environments, psychological mechanisms sometimes exhibit ""mismatches"" to the modern environmentOne example is the fact that although about 10,000 people are killed with guns in the US annually, whereas spiders and snakes kill only a handful, people nonetheless learn to fear spiders and snakes about as easily as they do a pointed gun, and more easily than an unpointed gun, rabbits or flowers",3
"A potential explanation is that spiders and snakes were a threat to human ancestors throughout the Pleistocene, whereas guns (and rabbits and flowers) were notThere is thus a mismatch between humans' evolved fear-learning psychology and the modern environment.This mismatch also shows up in the phenomena of the supernormal stimulus, a stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which the response evolvedThe term was coined by Niko Tinbergen to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist Deirdre Barrett said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals",3
"She explained junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats, and she says that television is an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing actionMagazine centerfolds and double cheeseburgers pull instincts intended for an environment of evolutionary adaptedness where breast development was a sign of health, youth and fertility in a prospective mate, and fat was a rare and vital nutrientThe psychologist Mark van Vugt recently argued that modern organizational leadership is a mismatch",3
"His argument is that humans are not adapted to work in large, anonymous bureaucratic structures with formal hierarchiesThe human mind still responds to personalized, charismatic leadership primarily in the context of informal, egalitarian settingsHence the dissatisfaction and alienation that many employees experienceSalaries, bonuses and other privileges exploit instincts for relative status, which attract particularly males to senior executive positions    Research methods   Evolutionary theory is heuristic in that it may generate hypotheses that might not be developed from other theoretical approaches",3
"One of the major goals of adaptationist research is to identify which organismic traits are likely to be adaptations, and which are byproducts or random variationsAs noted earlier, adaptations are expected to show evidence of complexity, functionality, and species universality, while byproducts or random variation will notIn addition, adaptations are expected to manifest as proximate mechanisms that interact with the environment in either a generally obligate or facultative fashion (see above)",3
"Evolutionary psychologists are also interested in identifying these proximate mechanisms (sometimes termed ""mental mechanisms"" or ""psychological adaptations"") and what type of information they take as input, how they process that information, and their outputsEvolutionary developmental psychology, or ""evo-devo,"" focuses on how adaptations may be activated at certain developmental times (e.g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc.) or how events during the development of an individual may alter life-history trajectoriesEvolutionary psychologists use several strategies to develop and test hypotheses about whether a psychological trait is likely to be an evolved adaptation",3
"Buss (2011) notes that these methods include:  Evolutionary psychologists also use various sources of data for testing, including experiments, archaeological records, data from hunter-gatherer societies, observational studies, neuroscience data, self-reports and surveys, public records, and human productsRecently, additional methods and tools have been introduced based on fictional scenarios, mathematical models, and multi-agent computer simulations    Main areas of research   Foundational areas of research in evolutionary psychology can be divided into broad categories of adaptive problems that arise from the theory of evolution itself: survival, mating, parenting, family and kinship, interactions with non-kin, and cultural evolution",3
"    Survival and individual-level psychological adaptations   Problems of survival are clear targets for the evolution of physical and psychological adaptationsMajor problems the ancestors of present-day humans faced included food selection and acquisition; territory selection and physical shelter; and avoiding predators and other environmental threats     Consciousness     Consciousness meets George Williams' criteria of species universality, complexity, and functionality, and it is a trait that apparently increases fitness.In his paper ""Evolution of consciousness,"" John Eccles argues that special anatomical and physical adaptations of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness",3
"In contrast, others have argued that the recursive circuitry underwriting consciousness is much more primitive, having evolved initially in pre-mammalian species because it improves the capacity for interaction with both social and natural environments by providing an energy-saving ""neutral"" gear in an otherwise energy-expensive motor output machineOnce in place, this recursive circuitry may well have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms, as outlined by Bernard J",3
"BaarsRichard Dawkins suggested that humans evolved consciousness in order to make themselves the subjects of thoughtDaniel Povinelli suggests that large, tree-climbing apes evolved consciousness to take into account one's own mass when moving safely among tree branchesConsistent with this hypothesis, Gordon Gallup found that chimpanzees and orangutans, but not little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas, demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests.The concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness",3
"However, even voluntary behavior involves unconscious mechanismsMany cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awarenessSome behaviors are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automaticLearning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousnessFor example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do soEvolutionary psychology approaches self-deception as an adaptation that can improve one's results in social exchanges.Sleep may have evolved to conserve energy when activity would be less fruitful or more dangerous, such as at night, and especially during the winter season",3
"     Sensation and perception     Many experts, such as Jerry Fodor, write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide actionFor example, they say, depth perception seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in spaceEvolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness",3
"More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitnessPerception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations to their surrounding worldsDepth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world",3
"Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objectsSound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objectsLarger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their sizeThe range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation",3
"Homing pigeons, for example, can hear the very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched soundsTaste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptednessFor example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, so present-day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes",3
"The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and painPain, while unpleasant, is adaptiveAn important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensationFor example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient lightSensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.Evolutionary psychologists contend that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks",3
"For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prosopagnosia)Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module     Learning and facultative adaptations    In evolutionary psychology, learning is said to be accomplished through evolved capacities, specifically facultative adaptationsFacultative adaptations express themselves differently depending on input from the environmentSometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development",3
"For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturationEvolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periodsThe input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditionsFor example, animals evolved Pavlovian conditioning in order to solve problems about causal relationshipsAnimals accomplish learning tasks most easily when those tasks resemble problems that they faced in their evolutionary past, such as a rat learning where to find food or water",3
"Learning capacities sometimes demonstrate differences between the sexesIn many animal species, for example, males can solve spatial problems faster and more accurately than females, due to the effects of male hormones during developmentThe same might be true of humans     Emotion and motivation     Motivations direct and energize behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negativeIn the early 1970s, Paul Ekman and colleagues began a line of research which suggests that many emotions are universal",3
"He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgustSocial emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the environment of evolutionary adaptednessFor example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be fearedShame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status",3
"Motivation has a neurobiological basis in the reward system of the brainRecently, it has been suggested that reward systems may evolve in such a way that there may be an inherent or unavoidable trade-off in the motivational system for activities of short versus long duration     Cognition    Cognition refers to internal representations of the world and internal information processingFrom an evolutionary psychology perspective, cognition is not ""general purpose,"" but uses heuristics, or strategies, that generally increase the likelihood of solving problems that the ancestors of present-day humans routinely faced",3
"For example, present-day humans are far more likely to solve logic problems that involve detecting cheating (a common problem given humans' social nature) than the same logic problem put in purely abstract termsSince the ancestors of present-day humans did not encounter truly random events, present-day humans may be cognitively predisposed to incorrectly identify patterns in random sequences""Gamblers' Fallacy"" is one example of thisGamblers may falsely believe that they have hit a ""lucky streak"" even when each outcome is actually random and independent of previous trials",3
"Most people believe that if a fair coin has been flipped 9 times and Heads appears each time, that on the tenth flip, there is a greater than 50% chance of getting TailsHumans find it far easier to make diagnoses or predictions using frequency data than when the same information is presented as probabilities or percentages, presumably because the ancestors of present-day humans lived in relatively small tribes (usually with fewer than 150 people) where frequency information was more readily available",3
"     Personality    Evolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological natureFrom an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle(Note: The field of behavioral genetics is concerned with statistically partitioning differences between people into genetic and environmental sources of varianceHowever, understanding the concept of heritability can be tricky – heritability refers only to the differences between people, never the degree to which the traits of an individual are due to environmental or genetic factors, since traits are always a complex interweaving of both.) Personality traits are conceptualized by evolutionary psychologists as due to normal variation around an optimum, due to frequency-dependent selection (behavioral polymorphisms), or as facultative adaptations",3
"Like variability in height, some personality traits may simply reflect inter-individual variability around a general optimumOr, personality traits may represent different genetically predisposed ""behavioral morphs"" – alternate behavioral strategies that depend on the frequency of competing behavioral strategies in the populationFor example, if most of the population is generally trusting and gullible, the behavioral morph of being a ""cheater"" (or, in the extreme case, a sociopath) may be advantageousFinally, like many other psychological adaptations, personality traits may be facultative – sensitive to typical variations in the social environment, especially during early development",3
"For example, later-born children are more likely than firstborns to be rebellious, less conscientious and more open to new experiences, which may be advantageous to them given their particular niche in family structureIt is important to note that shared environmental influences do play a role in personality and are not always of less importance than genetic factorsHowever, shared environmental influences often decrease to near zero after adolescence but do not completely disappear",3
"     Language     According to Steven Pinker, who builds on the work by Noam Chomsky, the universal human ability to learn to talk between the ages of 1 – 4, basically without training, suggests that language acquisition is a distinctly human psychological adaptation (see, in particular, Pinker's The Language Instinct)Pinker and Bloom (1990) argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex organs of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop.Pinker follows Chomsky in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction",3
"Chomsky himself does not believe language to have evolved as an adaptation, but suggests that it likely evolved as a byproduct of some other adaptation, a so-called spandrelBut Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.Evolutionary psychologists hold that the FOXP2 gene may well be associated with the evolution of human languageIn the 1980s, psycholinguist Myrna Gopnik identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the KE family of Britain",3
"This gene turned out to be a mutation of the FOXP2 geneHumans have a unique allele of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary historyThis unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humansHowever, the once-popular idea that FOXP2 is a 'grammar gene' or that it triggered the emergence of language in Homo sapiens is now widely discredited.Currently, several competing theories about the evolutionary origin of language coexist, none of them having achieved a general consensus",3
"Researchers of language acquisition in primates and humans such as Michael Tomasello and Talmy Givón, argue that the innatist framework has understated the role of imitation in learning and that it is not at all necessary to posit the existence of an innate grammar module to explain human language acquisitionTomasello argues that studies of how children and primates actually acquire communicative skills suggest that humans learn complex behavior through experience, so that instead of a module specifically dedicated to language acquisition, language is acquired by the same cognitive mechanisms that are used to acquire all other kinds of socially transmitted behavior.On the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a spandrel, evolutionary biologist W",3
"Tecumseh Fitch, following Stephen JGould, argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptationHe criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptionist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether ""Language has evolved as an adaptation"" as being misleadingHe argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system",3
"A similar argument is made by Terrence Deacon who in The Symbolic Species argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.If the theory that language could have evolved as a single adaptation is accepted, the question becomes which of its many functions has been the basis of adaptationSeveral evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that language evolved for the purpose of social grooming, that it evolved as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts",3
"Evolutionary psychologists recognize that these theories are all speculative and that much more evidence is required to understand how language might have been selectively adapted    Mating    Given that sexual reproduction is the means by which genes are propagated into future generations, sexual selection plays a large role in human evolutionHuman mating, then, is of interest to evolutionary psychologists who aim to investigate evolved mechanisms to attract and secure matesSeveral lines of research have stemmed from this interest, such as studies of mate selection mate poaching, mate retention, mating preferences and conflict between the sexes.In 1972 Robert Trivers published an influential paper on sex differences that is now referred to as parental investment theory",3
"The size differences of gametes (anisogamy) is the fundamental, defining difference between males (small gametes – sperm) and females (large gametes – ova)Trivers noted that anisogamy typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes, with females initially investing moreTrivers proposed that this difference in parental investment leads to the sexual selection of different reproductive strategies between the sexes and to sexual conflictFor example, he suggested that the sex that invests less in offspring will generally compete for access to the higher-investing sex to increase their inclusive fitness (also see Bateman's principle)",3
"Trivers posited that differential parental investment led to the evolution of sexual dimorphisms in mate choice, intra- and inter- sexual reproductive competition, and courtship displaysIn mammals, including humans, females make a much larger parental investment than males (i.egestation followed by childbirth and lactation)Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theoryBuss and Schmitt's (1993) Sexual Strategies Theory proposed that, due to differential parental investment, humans have evolved sexually dimorphic adaptations related to ""sexual accessibility, fertility assessment, commitment seeking and avoidance, immediate and enduring resource procurement, paternity certainty, assessment of mate value, and parental investment."" Their Strategic Interference Theory suggested that conflict between the sexes occurs when the preferred reproductive strategies of one sex interfere with those of the other sex, resulting in the activation of emotional responses such as anger or jealousy",3
"Women are generally more selective when choosing mates, especially under long-term mating conditionsHowever, under some circumstances, short term mating can provide benefits to women as well, such as fertility insurance, trading up to better genes, reducing the risk of inbreeding, and insurance protection of her offspring.Due to male paternity insecurity, sex differences have been found in the domains of sexual jealousyFemales generally react more adversely to emotional infidelity and males will react more to sexual infidelity",3
"This particular pattern is predicted because the costs involved in mating for each sex are distinctWomen, on average, should prefer a mate who can offer resources (e.g., financial, commitment), thus, a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelityMen, on the other hand, are never certain of the genetic paternity of their children because they do not bear the offspring themselves (""paternity insecurity"")This suggests that for men sexual infidelity would generally be more aversive than emotional infidelity because investing resources in another man's offspring does not lead to the propagation of their own genes.Another interesting line of research is that which examines women's mate preferences across the ovulatory cycle",3
"The theoretical underpinning of this research is that ancestral women would have evolved mechanisms to select mates with certain traits depending on their hormonal statusKnown as the ovulatory shift hypothesis, the theory posits that, during the ovulatory phase of a woman's cycle (approximately days 10–15 of a woman's cycle), a woman who mated with a male with high genetic quality would have been more likely, on average, to produce and bear a healthy offspring than a woman who mated with a male with low genetic quality",3
"These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspringThis hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cyclesIndeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycleIn particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates",3
"Creativity may be a proxy for good genesResearch by Gangestad et al(2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display social presence and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources    Parenting    Reproduction is always costly for women, and can also be for menIndividuals are limited in the degree to which they can devote time and resources to producing and raising their young, and such expenditure may also be detrimental to their future condition, survival and further reproductive output",3
"Parental investment is any parental expenditure (time, energy etc.) that benefits one offspring at a cost to parents' ability to invest in other components of fitness (Clutton-Brock 1991: 9; Trivers 1972)Components of fitness (Beatty 1992) include the well-being of existing offspring, parents' future reproduction, and inclusive fitness through aid to kin (Hamilton, 1964)Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theoryRobert Trivers' theory of parental investment predicts that the sex making the largest investment in lactation, nurturing and protecting offspring will be more discriminating in mating and that the sex that invests less in offspring will compete for access to the higher investing sex (see Bateman's principle)",3
"Sex differences in parental effort are important in determining the strength of sexual selectionThe benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival, and ultimately, on the reproductive success of the offspringHowever, these benefits can come at the cost of the parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.gthrough the increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, the loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring, and an increase in the time to the next reproduction",3
"Overall, parents are selected to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental care will likely evolve when the benefits exceed the costsThe Cinderella effect is an alleged high incidence of stepchildren being physically, emotionally or sexually abused, neglected, murdered, or otherwise mistreated at the hands of their stepparents at significantly higher rates than their genetic counterpartsIt takes its name from the fairy tale character Cinderella, who in the story was cruelly mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters",3
"Daly and Wilson (1996) noted: ""Evolutionary thinking led to the discovery of the most important risk factor for child homicide – the presence of a stepparentParental efforts and investments are valuable resources, and selection favors those parental psyches that allocate effort effectively to promote fitnessThe adaptive problems that challenge parental decision-making include both the accurate identification of one's offspring and the allocation of one's resources among them with sensitivity to their needs and abilities to convert parental investment into fitness increments…",3
"Stepchildren were seldom or never so valuable to one's expected fitness as one's own offspring would be, and those parental psyches that were easily parasitized by just any appealing youngster must always have incurred a selective disadvantage""(Daly & Wilson, 1996, pp64–65)However, they note that not all stepparents will ""want"" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is any insurance against abuseThey see step parental care as primarily ""mating effort"" towards the genetic parent",3
"    Family and kin    Inclusive fitness is the sum of an organism's classical fitness (how many of its own offspring it produces and supports) and the number of equivalents of its own offspring it can add to the population by supporting othersThe first component is called classical fitness by Hamilton (1964)From the gene's point of view, evolutionary success ultimately depends on leaving behind the maximum number of copies of itself in the population",3
"Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave the maximum number of viable offspringHowever, in 1964 WDHamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individualsHamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness",3
"It is also true that natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitnessHamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population:                         r         b         >         c                           {\displaystyle rb>c\ }   where                         c                           {\displaystyle c\ }    is the reproductive cost to the altruist,                         b                           {\displaystyle b\ }    is the reproductive benefit to the recipient of the altruistic behavior, and                         r                           {\displaystyle r\ }    is the probability, above the population average, of the individuals sharing an altruistic gene – commonly viewed as ""degree of relatedness"".The concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism",3
"If there is an ""altruism gene"" (or complex of genes) that influences an organism's behavior to be helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior also increases the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to common descentAltruists may also have some way to recognize altruistic behavior in unrelated individuals and be inclined to support themAs Dawkins points out in The Selfish Gene (Chapter 6) and The Extended Phenotype, this must be distinguished from the green-beard effect",3
"Although it is generally true that humans tend to be more altruistic toward their kin than toward non-kin, the relevant proximate mechanisms that mediate this cooperation have been debated (see kin recognition), with some arguing that kin status is determined primarily via social and cultural factors (such as co-residence, maternal association of sibs, etc.), while others have argued that kin recognition can also be mediated by biological factors such as facial resemblance and immunogenetic similarity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)",3
"For a discussion of the interaction of these social and biological kin recognition factors see Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides (2007) (PDF)Whatever the proximate mechanisms of kin recognition there is substantial evidence that humans act generally more altruistically to close genetic kin compared to genetic non-kin    Interactions with non-kin / reciprocity   Although interactions with non-kin are generally less altruistic compared to those with kin, cooperation can be maintained with non-kin via mutually beneficial reciprocity as was proposed by Robert Trivers",3
"If there are repeated encounters between the same two players in an evolutionary game in which each of them can choose either to ""cooperate"" or ""defect,"" then a strategy of mutual cooperation may be favored even if it pays each player, in the short term, to defect when the other cooperatesDirect reciprocity can lead to the evolution of cooperation only if the probability, w, of another encounter between the same two individuals exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:  w > c/bReciprocity can also be indirect if information about previous interactions is shared",3
"Reputation allows evolution of cooperation by indirect reciprocityNatural selection favors strategies that base the decision to help on the reputation of the recipient: studies show that people who are more helpful are more likely to receive helpThe calculations of indirect reciprocity are complicated and only a tiny fraction of this universe has been uncovered, but again a simple rule has emergedIndirect reciprocity can only promote cooperation if the probability, q, of knowing someone's reputation exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:  q > c/bOne important problem with this explanation is that individuals may be able to evolve the capacity to obscure their reputation, reducing the probability, q, that it will be known.Trivers argues that friendship and various social emotions evolved in order to manage reciprocity",3
"Liking and disliking, he says, evolved to help present-day humans' ancestors form coalitions with others who reciprocated and to exclude those who did not reciprocateMoral indignation may have evolved to prevent one's altruism from being exploited by cheaters, and gratitude may have motivated present-day humans' ancestors to reciprocate appropriately after benefiting from others' altruismLikewise, present-day humans feel guilty when they fail to reciprocateThese social motivations match what evolutionary psychologists expect to see in adaptations that evolved to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of reciprocity.Evolutionary psychologists say that humans have psychological adaptations that evolved specifically to help us identify nonreciprocators, commonly referred to as ""cheaters."" In 1993, Robert Frank and his associates found that participants in a prisoner's dilemma scenario were often able to predict whether their partners would ""cheat,"" based on a half-hour of unstructured social interaction",3
"In a 1996 experiment, for example, Linda Mealey and her colleagues found that people were better at remembering the faces of people when those faces were associated with stories about those individuals cheating (such as embezzling money from a church)    Strong reciprocity (or ""tribal reciprocity"")    Humans may have an evolved set of psychological adaptations that predispose them to be more cooperative than otherwise would be expected with members of their tribal in-group, and, more nasty to members of tribal out groups",3
"These adaptations may have been a consequence of tribal warfareHumans may also have predispositions for ""altruistic punishment"" – to punish in-group members who violate in-group rules, even when this altruistic behavior cannot be justified in terms of helping those you are related to (kin selection), cooperating with those who you will interact with again (direct reciprocity), or cooperating to better your reputation with others (indirect reciprocity)    Evolutionary psychology and culture    Though evolutionary psychology has traditionally focused on individual-level behaviors, determined by species-typical psychological adaptations, considerable work has been done on how these adaptations shape and, ultimately govern, culture (Tooby and Cosmides, 1989)",3
"Tooby and Cosmides (1989) argued that the mind consists of many domain-specific psychological adaptations, some of which may constrain what cultural material is learned or taughtAs opposed to a domain-general cultural acquisition program, where an individual passively receives culturally-transmitted material from the group, Tooby and Cosmides (1989), among others, argue that: ""the psyche evolved to generate adaptive rather than repetitive behavior, and hence critically analyzes the behavior of those surrounding it in highly structured and patterned ways, to be used as a rich (but by no means the only) source of information out of which to construct a 'private culture' or individually tailored adaptive system; in consequence, this system may or may not mirror the behavior of others in any given respect."" (Tooby and Cosmides 1989)",3
"    In psychology sub-fields       Developmental psychology    According to Paul Baltes, the benefits granted by evolutionary selection decrease with ageNatural selection has not eliminated many harmful conditions and nonadaptive characteristics that appear among older adults, such as Alzheimer diseaseIf it were a disease that killed 20-year-olds instead of 70-year-olds this may have been a disease that natural selection could have eliminated ages agoThus, unaided by evolutionary pressures against nonadaptive conditions, modern humans suffer the aches, pains, and infirmities of aging and as the benefits of evolutionary selection decrease with age, the need for modern technological mediums against non-adaptive conditions increases",3
"    Social psychology   As humans are a highly social species, there are many adaptive problems associated with navigating the social world (e.g., maintaining allies, managing status hierarchies, interacting with outgroup members, coordinating social activities, collective decision-making)Researchers in the emerging field of evolutionary social psychology have made many discoveries pertaining to topics traditionally studied by social psychologists, including person perception, social cognition, attitudes, altruism, emotions, group dynamics, leadership, motivation, prejudice, intergroup relations, and cross-cultural differences.When endeavouring to solve a problem humans at an early age show determination while chimpanzees have no comparable facial expression",3
"Researchers suspect the human determined expression evolved because when a human is determinedly working on a problem other people will frequently help    Abnormal psychology    Adaptationist hypotheses regarding the etiology of psychological disorders are often based on analogies between physiological and psychological dysfunctions, as noted in the table belowProminent theorists and evolutionary psychiatrists include Michael TMcGuire, Anthony Stevens, and Randolph MNesseThey, and others, suggest that mental disorders are due to the interactive effects of both nature and nurture, and often have multiple contributing causes",3
"Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may reflect a side-effect of genes with fitness benefits, such as increased creativity(Some individuals with bipolar disorder are especially creative during their manic phases and the close relatives of people with schizophrenia have been found to be more likely to have creative professions.) A 1994 report by the American Psychiatry Association found that people suffered from schizophrenia at roughly the same rate in Western and non-Western cultures, and in industrialized and pastoral societies, suggesting that schizophrenia is not a disease of civilization nor an arbitrary social invention",3
"Sociopathy may represent an evolutionarily stable strategy, by which a small number of people who cheat on social contracts benefit in a society consisting mostly of non-sociopathsMild depression may be an adaptive response to withdraw from, and re-evaluate, situations that have led to disadvantageous outcomes (the ""analytical rumination hypothesis"") (see Evolutionary approaches to depression)Some of these speculations have yet to be developed into fully testable hypotheses, and a great deal of research is required to confirm their validity",3
"    Antisocial and criminal behavior    Evolutionary psychology has been applied to explain criminal or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviorsMales are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearingMales being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by themMales of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless",3
"It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive successThis may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried are associated with criminalityFurthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period",3
"Some sociologists have underlined differential exposure to androgens as the cause of these behaviors, notably Lee Ellis in his evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory.Many conflicts that result in harm and death involve status, reputation, and seemingly trivial insultsSteven Pinker in his book The Blank Slate argues that in non-state societies without a police it was very important to have a credible deterrence against aggressionTherefore, it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans developing instincts for revenge as well as for protecting reputation (""honor"")",3
"Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environmentWhenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.Rape is theorized to be a reproductive strategy that facilitates the propagation of the rapist's progeny",3
"Such a strategy may be adopted by men who otherwise are unlikely to be appealing to women and therefore cannot form legitimate relationships, or by high-status men on socially vulnerable women who are unlikely to retaliate to increase their reproductive success even furtherThe sociobiological theories of rape are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation, and objections to this theory are made on ethical, religious, political, as well as scientific grounds",3
"    Psychology of religion    Adaptationist perspectives on religious belief suggest that, like all behavior, religious behaviors are a product of the human brainAs with all other organ functions, cognition's functional structure has been argued to have a genetic foundation, and is therefore subject to the effects of natural selection and sexual selectionLike other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst humans and should have solved important problems of survival and reproduction in ancestral environments",3
"However, evolutionary psychologists remain divided on whether religious belief is more likely a consequence of evolved psychological adaptations, or a byproduct of other cognitive adaptations    Coalitional psychology   Coalitional psychology is an approach to explain political behaviors between different coalitions and the conditionality of these behaviors in evolutionary psychological perspectiveThis approach assumes that since human beings appeared on the earth, they have evolved to live in groups instead of living as individuals to achieve benefits such as more mating opportunities and increased status",3
"Human beings thus naturally think and act in a way that manages and negotiates group dynamicsCoalitional psychology offers falsifiable ex ante prediction by positing five hypotheses on how these psychological adaptations operate: Humans represent groups as a special category of individual, unstable and with a short shadow of the future Political entrepreneurs strategically manipulate the coalitional environment, often appealing to emotional devices such as ""outrage"" to inspire collective actionRelative gains dominate relations with enemies, whereas absolute gains characterize relations with allies",3
"Coalitional size and male physical strength will positively predict individual support for aggressive foreign policiesIndividuals with children, particularly women, will vary in adopting aggressive foreign policies than those without progeny    Reception and criticism    Critics of evolutionary psychology accuse it of promoting genetic determinism, panadaptationism (the idea that all behaviors and anatomical features are adaptations), unfalsifiable hypotheses, distal or ultimate explanations of behavior when proximate explanations are superior, and malevolent political or moral ideas",3
"    Ethical implications   Critics have argued that evolutionary psychology might be used to justify existing social hierarchies and reactionary policiesIt has also been suggested by critics that evolutionary psychologists' theories and interpretations of empirical data rely heavily on ideological assumptions about race and gender.In response to such criticism, evolutionary psychologists often caution against committing the naturalistic fallacy – the assumption that ""what is natural"" is necessarily a moral goodHowever, their caution against committing the naturalistic fallacy has been criticized as means to stifle legitimate ethical discussions",3
"    Contradictions in models   Some criticisms of evolutionary psychology point at contradictions between different aspects of adaptive scenarios posited by evolutionary psychologyOne example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific essential nutrients so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes",3
"It is mentioned that some insects have societies with different ranks for each individual and that monkeys remain socially functioning after the removal of most of the brain as additional arguments against big brains promoting social networkingThe model of males as both providers and protectors is criticized for the impossibility of being in two places at once, the male cannot both protect his family at home and be out hunting at the same time",3
"In the case of the claim that a provider male could buy protection service for his family from other males by bartering food that he had hunted, critics point at the fact that the most valuable food (the food that contained the rarest essential nutrients) would be different in different ecologies and as such vegetable in some geographical areas and animal in others, making it impossible for hunting styles relying on physical strength or risk-taking to be universally of similar value in bartered food and instead of making it inevitable that in some parts of Africa, food gathered with no need for major physical strength would be the most valuable to barter for protection",3
"A contradiction between evolutionary psychology's claim of men needing to be more sexually visual than women for fast speed of assessing women's fertility than women needed to be able to assess the male's genes and its claim of male sexual jealousy guarding against infidelity is also pointed at, as it would be pointless for a male to be fast to assess female fertility if he needed to assess the risk of there being a jealous male mate and in that case his chances of defeating him before mating anyway (pointlessness of assessing one necessary condition faster than another necessary condition can possibly be assessed)",3
"    Standard social science model    Evolutionary psychology has been entangled in the larger philosophical and social science controversies related to the debate on nature versus nurtureEvolutionary psychologists typically contrast evolutionary psychology with what they call the standard social science model (SSSM)They characterize the SSSM as the ""blank slate"", ""relativist"", ""social constructionist"", and ""cultural determinist"" perspective that they say dominated the social sciences throughout the 20th century and assumed that the mind was shaped almost entirely by culture.Critics have argued that evolutionary psychologists created a false dichotomy between their own view and the caricature of the SSSM",3
"Other critics regard the SSSM as a rhetorical device or a straw man and suggest that the scientists whom evolutionary psychologists associate with the SSSM did not believe that the mind was a blank state devoid of any natural predispositions    Reductionism and determinism   Some critics view evolutionary psychology as a form of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism, a common critique being that evolutionary psychology does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases",3
"Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development)The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations)The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior",3
"    Testability of hypotheses    A frequent critique of the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do nowThus because there are a potentially infinite number of alternative explanations for why a trait evolved, critics contend that it is impossible to determine the exact explanation",3
"While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert that it is not impossiblePart of the critique of the scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA)Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which Homo sapiens evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculativeEvolutionary psychologists respond that they do know many things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc",3
"Edward Hagen argues that the human past environments were not radically different in the same sense as the Carboniferous or Jurassic periods and that the animal and plant taxa of the era were similar to those of the modern world, as was the geology and ecologyHagen argues that few would deny that other organs evolved in the EEA (for example, lungs evolving in an oxygen rich atmosphere) yet critics question whether or not the brain's EEA is truly knowable, which he argues constitutes selective scepticism",3
"Hagen also argues that most evolutionary psychology research is based on the fact that females can get pregnant and males cannot, which Hagen observes was also true in the EEA.John Alcock describes this as the ""No Time Machine Argument"", as critics are arguing that since it is not possible to travel back in time to the EEA, then it cannot be determined what was going on there and thus what was adaptive",3
"Alcock argues that present-day evidence allows researchers to be reasonably confident about the conditions of the EEA and that the fact that so many human behaviours are adaptive in the current environment is evidence that the ancestral environment of humans had much in common with the present one, as these behaviours would have evolved in the ancestral environmentThus Alcock concludes that researchers can make predictions on the adaptive value of traits",3
"Similarly, Dominic Murphy argues that alternative explanations cannot just be forwarded but instead need their own evidence and predictions - if one explanation makes predictions that the others cannot, it is reasonable to have confidence in that explanationIn addition, Murphy argues that other historical sciences also make predictions about modern phenomena to come up with explanations about past phenomena, for example, cosmologists look for evidence for what we would expect to see in the modern-day if the Big Bang was true, while geologists make predictions about modern phenomena to determine if an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs",3
"Murphy argues that if other historical disciplines can conduct tests without a time machine, then the onus is on the critics to show why evolutionary psychology is untestable if other historical disciplines are not, as ""methods should be judged across the board, not singled out for ridicule in one context.""     Modularity of mind    Evolutionary psychologists generally presume that, like the body, the mind is made up of many evolved modular adaptations, although there is some disagreement within the discipline regarding the degree of general plasticity, or ""generality,"" of some modules",3
"It has been suggested that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, it would have conferred an advantage in terms of fitness and because connection costs are lower.In contrast, some academics argue that it is unnecessary to posit the existence of highly domain specific modules, and, suggest that the neural anatomy of the brain supports a model based on more domain general faculties and processesMoreover, empirical support for the domain-specific theory stems almost entirely from performance on variations of the Wason selection task which is extremely limited in scope as it only tests one subtype of deductive reasoning",3
"    Cultural rather than genetic development of cognitive tools    Cecilia Heyes has argued that the picture presented by some evolutionary psychology of the human mind as a collection of cognitive instincts – organs of thought shaped by genetic evolution over very long time periods – does not fit research resultsShe posits instead that humans have cognitive gadgets – ""special-purpose organs of thought"" built in the course of development through social interactionSimilar criticisms are articulated by Subrena E",3
"Smith of the University of New Hampshire    Response by evolutionary psychologists   Evolutionary psychologists have addressed many of their critics (see, for example, books by Segerstråle (2000), Defenders of the Truth: The Battle for Science in the Sociobiology Debate and Beyond, Barkow (2005), Missing the Revolution: Darwinism for Social Scientists, and Alcock (2001), The Triumph of Sociobiology)Among their rebuttals are that some criticisms are straw men, are based on an incorrect nature versus nurture dichotomy, are based on misunderstandings of the discipline, etc",3

"In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activityIn essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of timeNamed by the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi in 1975, the concept has been widely referred to across a variety of fields (and is particularly well recognized in occupational therapy), though the concept has been claimed to have existed for thousands of years under other names.The flow state shares many characteristics with hyperfocus",3
"However, hyperfocus is not always described in a positive lightSome examples include spending ""too much"" time playing video games or becoming pleasurably absorbed by one aspect of an assignment or task to the detriment of the overall assignmentIn some cases, hyperfocus can ""capture"" a person, perhaps causing them to appear unfocused or to start several projects, but complete few    Components   Jeanne Nakamura and Csíkszentmihályi identify the following six factors as encompassing an experience of flow: Intense and focused concentration on the present moment Merging of action and awareness A loss of reflective self-consciousness A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity A distortion of temporal experience, as one's subjective experience of time is altered Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experienceThose aspects can appear independently of each other, but only in combination do they constitute a so-called flow experience",3
"Additionally, psychology writer Kendra Cherry has mentioned three other components that Csíkszentmihályi lists as being a part of the flow experience: Immediate feedback Feeling the potential to succeed Feeling so engrossed in the experience, that other needs become negligibleJust as with the conditions listed above, these conditions can be independent of one another    Etymology   Flow is so named because, during Csíkszentmihályi's 1975 interviews, several people described their ""flow"" experiences using the metaphor of a water current carrying them along: ""'It was like floating,' 'I was carried on by the flow.'""     History   Mihaly Csikszentmihályi and others began researching flow after Csikszentmihályi became fascinated by artists who would essentially get lost in their work",3
"Artists, especially painters, got so immersed in their work that they would disregard their need for food, water and even sleepThe theory of flow came about when Csikszentmihályi tried to understand the phenomenon experienced by these artistsFlow research became prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s, with Csikszentmihályi and his colleagues in Italy still at the forefrontResearchers interested in optimal experiences and emphasizing positive experiences, especially in places such as schools and the business world, also began studying the theory of flow at this time.The cognitive science of flow has been studied under the rubric of effortless attention",3
"    Mechanism   In any given moment, there is a great deal of information made available to each individualPsychologists have found that one's mind can attend to only a certain amount of information at a timeAccording to Csikszentmihályi's 2004 TED talk, that number is about ""110 bits of information per second""That may seem like a lot of information, but simple daily tasks take quite a lot of informationJust decoding speech takes about 40-60 bits of information per second",3
"That is why when having a conversation one cannot focus as much attention on other things.For the most part (except for basic bodily feelings like hunger and pain, which are innate), people are able to decide what they want to focus their attention onHowever, when one is in the flow state, they are completely engrossed with the one task at hand and, without making the conscious decision to do so, lose awareness of all other things: time, people, distractions, and even basic bodily needs",3
"According to Csikszentmihályi, this occurs because all of the attention of the person in the flow state is on the task at hand; there is no more attention to be allocated.The flow state has been described by Csikszentmihályi as the ""optimal experience"" in that one gets to a level of high gratification from the experienceAchieving this experience is considered to be personal and ""depends on the ability"" of the individualOne's capacity and desire to overcome challenges in order to achieve their ultimate goals leads not only to the optimal experience but also to a sense of life satisfaction overall",3
"    Measurement   There are three common ways to measure flow experiences: the flow questionnaire (FQ), the experience sampling method (ESM), and the ""standardized scales of the componential approach.""     Flow questionnaire   The FQ requires individuals to identify definitions of flow and situations in which they believe that they have experienced flow, followed by a section that asks them to evaluate their personal experiences in these flow-inducing situationsThe FQ identifies flow as multiple constructs, therefore allowing the results to be used to estimate differences in the likelihood of experiencing flow across a variety of factors",3
"Another strength of the FQ is that it does not assume that everyone's flow experiences are the sameBecause of this, the FQ is the ideal measure for estimating the prevalence of flowHowever, the FQ has some weaknesses that more recent methods have set out to addressThe FQ does not allow for measurement of the intensity of flow during specific activitiesThis method also does not measure the influence of the ratio of challenge to skill on the flow state",3
"    Experience sampling method   The ESM requires individuals to fill out the experience sampling form (ESF) at eight randomly chosen time intervals throughout the dayThe purpose of this is to understand subjective experiences by estimating the time intervals that individuals spend in specific states during everyday lifeThe ESF is made up of 13 categorical items and 29 scaled itemsThe purpose of the categorical items is to determine the context and motivational aspects of the current actions (these items include: time, location, companionship/desire for companionship, activity being performed, reason for performing activity)",3
"Because these questions are open-ended, the answers need to be coded by researchersThis needs to be done carefully so as to avoid any biases in the statistical analysisThe scaled items are intended to measure the levels of a variety of subjective feelings that the individual may be experiencingThe ESM is more complex than the FQ and contributes to the understanding of how flow plays out in a variety of situations, however the possible biases make it a risky choice",3
"    Standardized scales   Some researchers are not satisfied with the methods mentioned above and have set out to create their own scalesThe scales developed by Jackson and Eklund are the most commonly used in research, mainly because they are still consistent with Csíkszentmihályi's definition of flow and consider flow as being both a state and a traitJackson and Eklund created two scales that have been proven to be psychometrically valid and reliable: the flow state scale-2 (which measures flow as a state) and the dispositional flow scale-2 (designed to measure flow as either a general trait or domain-specific trait)",3
"The statistical analysis of the individual results from these scales gives a much more complete understanding of flow than the ESM and the FQ    Characteristics    The flow state can be entered while performing any activity, although it is more likely to occur when the task or activity is wholeheartedly engaged for intrinsic purposesPassive activities like taking a bath or even watching TV usually do not elicit a flow experience because active engagement is prerequisite to entering the flow state",3
"While the activities that induce flow vary and may be multifaceted, Csikszentmihályi asserts that the experience of flow is similar whatever the activity.Flow theory postulates that three conditions must be met to achieve flow:  The activity must have clear goals and progressThis establishes structure and directionThe task must provide clear and immediate feedbackThis helps to negotiate any changing demands and allows adjusting performance to maintain the flow stateGood balance is required between the perceived challenges of the task and one's perceived skills",3
"Confidence in the ability to complete the task is required.It has been argued that the antecedent factors of flow are interrelated, as a perceived balance between challenges and skills requires that the goals are clear and feedback is effectiveThus, the coordination of perceived demands and task skills can be identified as the central precondition of flow experience.In 1987, Massimini, Csíkszentmihályi and Carli published the eight-channel model of flow Antonella Delle Fave, who worked with Fausto Massimini at the University of Milan, calls this graph the Experience Fluctuation Model",3
The model depicts the channels of experience that result from different levels of perceived challenges and perceived skillsThe graph illustrates another aspect of flow: it is more likely to occur when the activity is a higher-than-average challenge (above the center point) and the individual has above-average skills (to the right of the center point)The center of the graph where the sectors meet represents the average level of challenge and skill across all individual daily activities,3
"The further from the center an experience is, the greater the intensity of that state of being, whether it is flow or anxiety or boredom or relaxation.Several problems of the model have been discussed in literatureOne is that it does not ensure the perceived balance between challenges and skills which is said to be the central precondition of flow experienceIndividuals with a low average level of skills and a high average level of challenges (or the converse) do not necessarily experience a match between skills and challenges when both are above their individual average",3
"Another study found that low challenge situations which were surpassed by skill were associated with enjoyment, relaxation, and happiness, which, they claim, is contrary to flow theory.Schaffer (2013) proposed seven flow conditions:  Knowing what to do Knowing how to do it Knowing how well you are doing Knowing where to go (if navigation is involved) High perceived challenges High perceived skills Freedom from distractionsSchaffer published a flow condition questionnaire (FCQ), to measure each of these seven flow conditions for any given task or activity",3
"    Challenges to maintaining flow   Some of the challenges to staying in flow include states of apathy, boredom, and anxietyThe state of apathy is characterized by easy challenges and low skill level requirements, resulting in a general lack of interest in the activityBoredom is a slightly different state that occurs when challenges are few, but one's skill level exceeds those challenges causing one to seek higher challengesA state of anxiety occurs when challenges are high enough to exceed perceived skill level, causing distress and uneasiness",3
"These states in general prevent achieving the balance necessary for flowCsíkszentmihályi has said, ""If challenges are too low, one gets back to flow by increasing themIf challenges are too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills.""     The autotelic personality   Csíkszentmihályi hypothesized that people with certain personality traits may be better able to achieve flow than the average personThese traits include curiosity, persistence, low egotism, and a high propensity to perform activities for intrinsic reasons",3
"People with most of these personality traits are said to have an autotelic personalityThe term “autotelic” derives from two Greek words, auto, meaning self, and telos meaning goalBeing autotelic means having a self-contained activity, without the expectation of future benefit, but simply to be experienced.There is scant research on the autotelic personality, but results of the few studies that have been conducted suggest that indeed some people are more likely to experience flow than others",3
"One researcher (Abuhamdeh, 2000) found that people with an autotelic personality have a greater preference for ""high-action-opportunity, high-skills situations that stimulate them and encourage growth"" compared to those without an autotelic personalityIt is in such high-challenge, high-skills situations that people are most likely to experience flowExperimental evidence shows that a balance between individual skills, and demands of the task (compared to boredom and overload) only elicits the flow experience in individuals having an internal locus of control or a habitual action orientation",3
"Several correlational studies found need for achievement to be a personal characteristic that fosters flow experiences    Group    Group flow (or team flow) is notably different from independent flow as it is inherently mutualGroup flow is attainable when the performance unit is a group, such as a team or musical groupWhen groups cooperate to agree on goals and patterns, social flow, commonly known as group cohesion, is much more likely to occur",3
"If a group still has not entered flow, a team-level challenge may stimulate the group to harmonize    Applications       Applications suggested by Csíkszentmihályi versus other practitioners   Only Csíkszentmihályi seems to have published suggestions for extrinsic applications of the flow concept, such as design methods for playgrounds to elicit the flow experienceOther practitioners of Csíkszentmihályi's flow concept focus on intrinsic applications, such as spirituality, performance improvement, or self-helpHis work has also informed the measurement of donor momentum by The New Science of Philanthropy",3
"    Education    In education, the concept of overlearning plays a role in a student's ability to achieve flowCsíkszentmihályi states that overlearning enables the mind to concentrate on visualizing the desired performance as a singular, integrated action instead of a set of actionsChallenging assignments that (slightly) stretch one's skills lead to flow.In the 1950s British cybernetician Gordon Pask designed an adaptive teaching machine called SAKI, an early example of ""e-learning""The machine is discussed in some detail in Stafford Beer's book ""Cybernetics and Management""",3
"In the patent application for SAKI (1956), Pask's comments (some of which are included below) indicate an awareness of the pedagogical importance of balancing student competence with didactic challenge, which is quite consistent with flow theory:  If the operator is receiving data at too slow a rate, he is likely to become bored and attend to other irrelevant dataIf the data given indicates too precisely what responses the operator is required to make, the skill becomes too easy to perform and the operator again tends to become bored",3
"If the data given is too complicated or is given at too great a rate, the operator is unable to deal with itHe is then liable to become discouraged and lose interest in performing or learning the skill Ideally, for an operator to perform a skill efficiently, the data presented to him should always be of sufficient complexity to maintain his interest and maintain a competitive situation, but not so complex as to discourage the operator",3
"Similarly these conditions should obtain at each stage of a learning process if it is to be efficientA tutor teaching one pupil seeks to maintain just these conditionsAround 2000, it came to the attention of Csíkszentmihályi that the principles and practices of the Montessori Method of education seemed to purposefully set up continuous flow opportunities and experiences for studentsCsíkszentmihályi and psychologist Kevin Rathunde embarked on a multi-year study of student experiences in Montessori settings and traditional educational settings",3
"The research supported observations that students achieved flow experiences more frequently in Montessori settings    Music   Musicians, especially improvisational soloists, may experience a state of flow while playing their instrumentResearch has shown that performers in a flow state have a heightened quality of performance as opposed to when they are not in a flow stateIn a study performed with professional classical pianists who played piano pieces several times to induce a flow state, a significant relationship was found between the flow state of the pianist and the pianist's heart rate, blood pressure, and major facial muscles",3
"As the pianist entered the flow state, heart rate and blood pressure decreased and the major facial muscles relaxedThis study further emphasized that flow is a state of effortless attentionIn spite of the effortless attention and overall relaxation of the body, the performance of the pianist during the flow state improved.Groups of drummers experience a state of flow when they sense a collective energy that drives the beat, something they refer to as getting into the groove or entrainment",3
"Likewise drummers and bass guitarists often describe a state of flow when they are feeling the downbeat together as being in the pocketResearchers have measured flow through subscales; challenge-skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clear goals, unambiguous feedback, total concentration, sense of control, loss of self-consciousness, transformation of time and autotelic experience    Sports    The concept of being in the zone during an athletic performance fits within Csíkszentmihályi's description of the flow experience, and theories and applications of being in the zone and its relationship with athletic competitive advantage are topics studied in the field of sport psychology.Timothy Gallwey's influential works on the ""inner game"" of sports such as golf and tennis described the mental coaching and attitudes required to ""get in the zone"" and fully internalize mastery of the sport.Roy Palmer suggests that ""being in the zone"" may also influence movement patterns as better integration of the conscious and subconscious reflex functions improves coordination",3
"Many athletes describe the effortless nature of their performance while achieving personal bests.In many martial arts, the term Budō is used to describe psychological flowMixed martial arts champion and Karate master Lyoto Machida uses meditation techniques before fights to attain mushin, a concept that, by his description, is in all respects equal to flowThe Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, during qualifying for the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix, explained: ""I was already on pole, [...] and I just kept going",3
"Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same carAnd suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciouslyI was driving it by a kind of instinct, only I was in a different dimensionIt was like I was in a tunnel.""Former 500 GP rider Wayne Gardner talking about his victory at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix on The Unrideables 2 documentary said: ""During these last five laps I had this sort of above body experience where actually raised up above and I could see myself racing",3
"It was kind of a remote control and it's the weirdest thing I've ever had in my life[...]"" After the race Mick [Doohan] and in fact Wayne Rainey said: ""How the hell did you do that?"" and I said: ""I have no idea.""     Religion and spirituality   In yogic traditions such as Raja Yoga, reference is made to a state of flow in the practice of Samyama, a psychological absorption in the object of meditation",3
"    Games and gaming   Flow in games and gaming has been linked to the laws of learning as part of the explanation for why learning-games (the use of games to introduce material, improve understanding, or increase retention) have the potential to be effectiveIn particular, flow is intrinsically motivating, which is part of the law of readinessThe condition of feedback, required for flow, is associated with the feedback aspects of the law of exercise",3
"This is exhibited in well designed games, in particular, where players perform at the edge of their competency as they are guided by clear goals and feedbackThe positive emotions associated with flow are associated with the law of effectThe intense experiences of being in a state of flow are directly associated with the law of intensityThus, the experience of gaming can be so engaging and motivating as it meets many of the laws of learning, which are inextricably connected to creating flow",3
"In games often much can be achieved thematically through an imbalance between challenge level and skill levelHorror games often keep challenges significantly above the player's level of competency in order to foster a continuous feeling of anxietyConversely, so called ""relaxation games"" keep the level of challenges significantly below the player's competency level, in order to achieve an opposite effectThe video game Flow was designed as part of Jenova Chen's master's thesis for exploring the design decisions that allow players to achieve the flow state, by adjusting the difficulty dynamically during play.It improves performance; calling the phenomenon ""TV trance"", a 1981 BYTE article discussed how ""the best seem to enter a trance where they play but don't pay attention to the details of the game""",3
"The primary goal of games is to create entertainment through intrinsic motivation, which is related to flow; that is, without intrinsic motivation it is virtually impossible to establish flowThrough the balance of skill and challenge the player's brain is aroused, with attention engaged and motivation highThus, the use of flow in games helps foster an enjoyable experience which in turn increases motivation and draws players to continue playingAs such, game designers strive to integrate flow principles into their projects",3
"Overall, the experience of play is fluid and is intrinsically psychologically rewarding independent of scores or in-game successes in the flow state    Design of intrinsically motivated computer systems   A simplified modification to flow has been combined with the technology acceptance model (TAM) to help guide the design of and explain the adoption of intrinsically motivated computer systemsThis model, the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) is modelled to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption",3
"HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and for general gamificationInstead of a minor, TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based concept of cognitive absorption (CA)The HMSAM further builds on van der Heijden's (2004) model of hedonic system adoption by including CA as a key mediator of perceived ease of use (PEOU) and of behavioral intentions to use (BIU) hedonic-motivation systems",3
"Typically, models simplistically represent ""intrinsic motivations"" by mere perceived enjoyedInstead, HMSAM uses the more complex, rich construct of CA, which includes joy, control, curiosity, focused immersion, and temporal dissociationCA is construct that is grounded in the seminal flow literature, yet CA has traditionally been used as a static construct, as if all five of its subconstructs occur at the same time—in direct contradiction to the flow literatureThus, part of HMSAM's contribution is to return CA closer to its flow roots by re-ordering these CA subconstructs into more natural process-variance order as predicted by flow",3
"Empirical data collection along with mediation tests further support this modeling approach    Professions and work   Developers of computer software reference getting into a flow state as ""wired in"", or sometimes as The Zone, hack mode, or operating on software time when developing in an undistracted stateStock market operators often use the term ""in the pipe"" to describe the psychological state of flow when trading during high volume days and market corrections",3
"Professional poker players use the term ""playing the A-game"" when referring to the state of highest concentration and strategical awareness, while pool players often call the state being in ""dead stroke""    In the workplace   Conditions of flow, defined as a state in which challenges and skills are equally matched, play an extremely important role in the workplaceBecause flow is associated with achievement, its development could have concrete implications in increasing workplace satisfaction and accomplishment",3
"Flow researchers, such as Csikszentmihályi, believe that certain interventions may be performed to enhance and increase flow in the workplace, through which people would gain 'intrinsic rewards that encourage persistence"" and provide benefitsIn his consultation work, Csikszentmihályi emphasizes finding activities and environments that are conducive to flow, and then identifying and developing personal characteristics to increase experiences of flowApplying these methods in the workplace can improve morale by fostering a sense of greater happiness and accomplishment, which may be correlated with increased performance",3
"In his review of Mihály Csikszentmihályi's book ""Good Business: Leadership, Flow, and the Making of Meaning"", Coert Visser introduces the ideas presented by Csikszentmihályi, including ""good work"" in which one ""enjoys doing your best while at the same time contributing to something beyond yourself."" He then provides tools by which managers and employees can create an atmosphere that encourages good workSome consultants suggest that the experience sampling form (EMS) method be used for individuals and teams in the workplace in order to identify how time is currently being spent, and where focus should be redirected to in order to increase flow experiences.In order to achieve flow, Csikszentmihályi lays out the following three conditions:  Goals are clear Feedback is immediate A balance exists between opportunity and capacityCsikszentmihályi argues that with increased experiences of flow, people experience ""growth towards complexity""",3
"People flourish as their achievements grow and with that comes development of increasing ""emotional, cognitive, and social complexity."" Creating a workplace atmosphere that allows for flow and growth, Csikszentmihályi argues, can increase the happiness and achievement of employeesAn increasingly popular way of promoting greater flow in the workplace is using the ""serious play"" facilitation methodsSome commercial organisations have used the concept of flow in building corporate branding and identity, for example, The Floow Limited, which created its company brand from the concept",3
"    Barriers   There are, however, barriers to achieving flow in the workplaceIn his chapter ""Why Flow Doesn't Happen on the Job,"" Csikszentmihályi argues the first reason that flow does not occur is that the goals of one's job are not clearHe explains that while some tasks at work may fit into a larger, organization plan, the individual worker may not see where their individual task fits itSecond, limited feedback about one's work can reduce motivation and leaves the employee unaware of whether or not they did a good job",3
"When there is little communication of feedback, an employee may not be assigned tasks that challenge them or seem important, which could potentially prevent an opportunity for flowIn the study ""Predicting flow at work: Investigating the activities and job characteristics that predict flow states at work"", Karina Nielsen and Bryan Cleal used a 9-item flow scale to examine predictors of flow at two levels: activity level (such as brainstorming, problem solving, and evaluation) and at a more stable level (such as role clarity, influence, and cognitive demands)",3
"They found that activities such as planning, problem solving, and evaluation predicted transient flow states, but that more stable job characteristics were not found to predict flow at workThis study can help us identify which task at work can be cultivated and emphasized in order to help employees experience flow on the jobIn her article in Positive Psychology News Daily, Kathryn Britton examines the importance of experiencing flow in the workplace beyond the individual benefits it creates",3
"She writes, ""Flow isn't just valuable to individuals; it also contributes to organizational goalsFor example, frequent experiences of flow at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development (Csikszentmihályi, 1991, 2004)So finding ways to increase the frequency of flow experiences can be one way for people to work together to increase the effectiveness of their workplaces.""     Outcomes       Positive experiences   Books by Csikszentmihályi suggest that enhancing the time spent in flow makes our lives more happy and successful",3
"Flow experiences are predicted to lead to positive affect as well as to better performanceFor example, delinquent behavior was reduced in adolescents after two years of enhancing flow through activities.People who have experienced flow, describe the following feelings:  Completely involved in what we are doing – focused, concentratedA sense of ecstasy – of being outside everyday realityGreat inner clarity – knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing",3
"Knowing that the activity is doable – that our skills are adequate to the taskA sense of serenity – no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the egoTimelessness – thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by the minuteIntrinsic motivation – whatever produces flow becomes its own reward.However, further empirical evidence is required to substantiate these preliminary indications, as flow researchers continue to explore the problem of how to directly investigate causal consequences of flow experiences using modern scientific instrumentation to observe the neuro-physiological correlates of the flow state",3
"     Positive affect and life satisfaction    Flow is an innately positive experience; it is known to ""produce intense feelings of enjoyment""An experience that is so enjoyable should lead to positive affect and happiness in the long runAlso, Csikszentmihályi stated that happiness is derived from personal development and growth – and flow situations permit the experience of personal development.Several studies found that flow experiences and positive affect go hand in hand, and that challenges and skills above the individual's average foster positive affect",3
"However, the causal processes underlying those relationships remain unclear at present     Performance and learning    Flow experiences imply a growth principleWhen one is in a flow state, they are working to master the activity at handTo maintain that flow state, one must seek increasingly greater challengesAttempting these new, difficult challenges stretches one's skillsOne emerges from such a flow experience with a bit of personal growth and great ""feelings of competence and efficacy""",3
"By increasing time spent in flow, intrinsic motivation and self-directed learning also increases.Flow has a documented correlation with high performance in the fields of artistic and scientific creativity, teaching, learning, and sports;Flow has been linked to persistence and achievement in activities while also helping to lower anxiety during various activities and raise self-esteem.However, evidence regarding better performance in flow situations is mixedFor sure, the association between the two is a reciprocal one",3
"That is, flow experiences may foster better performance but, on the other hand, good performance makes flow experiences more likelyResults of a longitudinal study in the academic context indicate that the causal effect of flow on performance is only of small magnitude and the strong relationship between the two is driven by an effect of performance on flowIn the long run, flow experiences in a specific activity may lead to higher performance in that activity as flow is positively correlated with a higher subsequent motivation to perform and to perform well",3
"    Criticism    Csikszentmihályi writes about the dangers of flow himself: ...enjoyable activities that produce flow have a potentially negative effect: while they are capable of improving the quality of existence by creating order in the mind, they can become addictive, at which point the self becomes captive of a certain kind of order, and is then unwilling to cope with the ambiguities of lifeFurther, he writes: The flow experience, like everything else, is not ""good"" in an absolute sense",3
"It is good only in that it has the potential to make life more rich, intense, and meaningful; it is good because it increases the strengths and complexity of the selfBut whether the consequence of any particular instance of flow is good in a larger sense needs to be discussed and evaluated in terms of more inclusive social criteriaKeller and Landhäußer (2012, p56) advocate for a flow intensity model because many models of flow have trouble predicting the intensity of flow experiences that can occur under various circumstances where skill and task demands fit together to produce flow.Cowley et",3

"Gestalt psychology, gestaltism or configurationism  is a school of psychology that emerged in the early twentieth century in Austria and Germany as a theory of perception that was a rejection of basic principles of Wilhelm Wundt's and Edward Titchener's elementalist and structuralist psychology.As used in Gestalt psychology, the German word Gestalt ( gə-SHTA(H)LT, -⁠STAHLT, -⁠S(H)TAWLT, German: [ɡəˈʃtalt] (listen); meaning ""form"") is interpreted as ""pattern"" or ""configuration""Gestalt psychologists emphasized that organisms perceive entire patterns or configurations, not merely individual components",3
"The view is sometimes summarized using the adage, ""the whole is more than the sum of its parts."": 13  Gestalt principles, proximity, similarity, figure-ground, continuity, closure, and connection, describe how humans perceive visuals in connection with different objects and environmentsGestalt psychology was founded on works by Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka    Origin and history    Max Wertheimer (1880–1943), Kurt Koffka (1886–1941), and Wolfgang Köhler (1887–1967) founded Gestalt psychology in the early 20th century.: 113–116  The dominant view in psychology at the time was structuralism, exemplified by the work of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894), Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), and Edward B",3
"Titchener (1867–1927).: 3  Structuralism was rooted firmly in British empiricism: 3  and was based on three closely interrelated theories:   ""atomism,"" also known as ""elementalism,"": 3  the view that all knowledge, even complex abstract ideas, is built from simple, elementary constituents ""sensationalism,"" the view that the simplest constituents—the atoms of thought—are elementary sense impressions ""associationism,"" the view that more complex ideas arise from the association of simpler ideas.: 3  Together, these three theories give rise to the view that the mind constructs all perceptions and even abstract thoughts strictly from lower-level sensations that are related solely by being associated closely in space and time",3
"The Gestaltists took issue with this widespread ""atomistic"" view that the aim of psychology should be to break consciousness down into putative basic elementsIn contrast, the Gestalt psychologists believed that breaking psychological phenomena down into smaller parts would not lead to understanding psychology.: 13  The Gestalt psychologists believed, instead, that the most fruitful way to view psychological phenomena is as organized, structured wholes.: 13  They argued that the psychological ""whole"" has priority and that the ""parts"" are defined by the structure of the whole, rather than vice versa",3
"One could say that the approach was based on a macroscopic view of psychology rather than a microscopic approachGestalt theories of perception are based on human nature being inclined to understand objects as an entire structure rather than the sum of its parts.Wertheimer had been a student of Austrian philosopher, Christian von Ehrenfels (1859–1932), a member of the School of BrentanoVon Ehrenfels introduced the concept of Gestalt to philosophy and psychology in 1890, before the advent of Gestalt psychology as such",3
"Von Ehrenfels observed that a perceptual experience, such as perceiving a melody or a shape, is more than the sum of its sensory componentsHe claimed that, in addition to the sensory elements of the perception, there is something extraAlthough in some sense derived from the organization of the component sensory elements, this further quality is an element in its own rightHe called it Gestalt-qualität or ""form-quality."" For instance, when one hears a melody, one hears the notes plus something in addition to them that binds them together into a tune – the Gestalt-qualität",3
"It is this Gestalt-qualität that, according to von Ehrenfels, allows a tune to be transposed to a new key, using completely different notes, while still retaining its identityThe idea of a Gestalt-qualität has roots in theories by David Hume, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Immanuel Kant, David Hartley,  and Ernst MachBoth von Ehrenfels and Edmund Husserl seem to have been inspired by Mach's work Beiträge zur Analyse der Empfindungen (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of gestalt and figural moment, respectively.By 1914, the first published references to Gestalt theory could be found in a footnote of Gabriele von Wartensleben's application of Gestalt theory to personality",3
"She was a student at Frankfurt Academy for Social Sciences, who interacted deeply with Wertheimer and Köhler.Through a series of experiments, Wertheimer discovered that a person observing a pair of alternating bars of light can, under the right conditions, experience the illusion of movement between one location and the otherHe noted that this was a perception of motion absent any moving objectThat is, it was pure phenomenal motionHe dubbed it phi (""phenomenal"") motion",3
"Wertheimer's publication of these results in 1912 marks the beginning of Gestalt psychologyIn comparison to von Ehrenfels and others who had used the term ""gestalt"" earlier in various ways, Wertheimer's unique contribution was to insist that the ""gestalt"" is perceptually primaryThe gestalt defines the parts from which it is composed, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts Wertheimer took the more radical position that ""what is given me by the melody does not arise ..",3
"as a secondary process from the sum of the pieces as suchInstead, what takes place in each single part already depends upon what the whole is"", (1925/1938)In other words, one hears the melody first and only then may perceptually divide it up into notesSimilarly, in vision, one sees the form of the circle first—it is given ""im-mediately"" (i.e., its apprehension is not mediated by a process of part-summation)Only after this primary apprehension might one notice that it is made up of lines or dots or stars",3
"The two men who served as Wertheimer's subjects in the phi experiments were Köhler and KoffkaKöhler was an expert in physical acoustics, having studied under physicist Max Planck (1858–1947), but had taken his degree in psychology under Carl Stumpf (1848–1936)Koffka was also a student of Stumpf's, having studied movement phenomena and psychological aspects of rhythmIn 1917, Köhler (1917/1925) published the results of four years of research on learning in chimpanzees",3
"Köhler showed, contrary to the claims of most other learning theorists, that animals can learn by ""sudden insight"" into the ""structure"" of a problem, over and above the associative and incremental manner of learning that Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936) and Edward Lee Thorndike (1874–1949) had demonstrated with dogs and cats, respectivelyThe terms ""structure"" and ""organization"" were focal for the Gestalt psychologistsStimuli were said to have a certain structure, to be organized in a certain way, and that it is to this structural organization, rather than to individual sensory elements, that the organism responds",3
"When an animal is conditioned, it does not simply respond to the absolute properties of a stimulus, but to its properties relative to its surroundingsTo use a favorite example of Köhler's, if conditioned to respond in a certain way to the lighter of two gray cards, the animal generalizes the relation between the two stimuli rather than the absolute properties of the conditioned stimulus: it will respond to the lighter of two cards in subsequent trials even if the darker card in the test trial is of the same intensity as the lighter one in the original training trials",3
"In 1921, Koffka published a Gestalt-oriented text on developmental psychology, Growth of the MindWith the help of American psychologist Robert Ogden, Koffka introduced the Gestalt point of view to an American audience in 1922 by way of a paper in Psychological BulletinIt contains criticisms of then-current explanations of a number of problems of perception, and the alternatives offered by the Gestalt schoolKoffka moved to the United States in 1924, eventually settling at Smith College in 1927",3
"In 1935, Koffka published his Principles of Gestalt PsychologyThis textbook laid out the Gestalt vision of the scientific enterprise as a wholeScience, he said, is not the simple accumulation of factsWhat makes research scientific is the incorporation of facts into a theoretical structureThe goal of the Gestaltists was to integrate the facts of inanimate nature, life, and mind into a single scientific structureThis meant that science would have to accommodate not only what Koffka called the quantitative facts of physical science but the facts of two other ""scientific categories"": questions of order and questions of Sinn, a German word which has been variously translated as significance, value, and meaning",3
"Without incorporating the meaning of experience and behavior, Koffka believed that science would doom itself to trivialities in its investigation of human beingsHaving survived the Nazis up to the mid-1930s, all the core members of the Gestalt movement were forced out of Germany to the United States by 1935Köhler published another book, Dynamics in Psychology, in 1940 but thereafter the Gestalt movement suffered a series of setbacksKoffka died in 1941 and Wertheimer in 1943",3
"Wertheimer's long-awaited book on mathematical problem-solving, Productive Thinking, was published posthumously in 1945, but Köhler was left to guide the movement without his two long-time colleagues    Gestalt therapy   Gestalt psychology should not be confused with the Gestalt therapy, which is only peripherally linked to Gestalt psychologyThe founders of Gestalt therapy, Fritz and Laura Perls, had worked with Kurt Goldstein, a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism",3
"Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz PerlsThe extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, howeverIn any case, it is not identical to Gestalt psychologyOn the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term ""Gestalt"" to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the Gestalt psychologists would object to it;, on the other hand, Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work",3
"Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most Gestalt psychologists emphasize that Gestalt therapy is not a form of Gestalt psychologyMary Henle noted in her presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association (1975): ""What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions—often unclear and often incompatible—from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy",3
"His work has no substantive relation to scientific Gestalt psychologyTo use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is not Gestalt psychology"" With her analysis, however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method.There have been clinical applications of Gestalt psychology in the psychotherapeutic field long before Perls'ian Gestalt therapy, in group psychoanalysis (Foulkes), Adlerian individual psychology, by Gestalt psychologists in psychotherapy like Erwin Levy, Abraham S",3
"Luchins, by Gestalt psychologically oriented psychoanalysts in Italy (Canestrari and others), and there have been newer developments foremost in EuropeFor example, a strictly Gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy, developed by the German Gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist Hans-Jürgen Walter and his colleagues in Germany, Austria (Gerhard Stemberger and colleagues) and SwitzerlandOther countries, especially Italy, have seen similar developments    Contributions   Gestalt psychology made many contributions to the body of psychology",3
"The Gestaltists were the first to demonstrate empirically and document many facts about perception—including facts about the perception of movement, the perception of contour, perceptual constancy, and perceptual illusionsWertheimer's discovery of the phi phenomenon is one example of such a contributionIn addition to discovering perceptual phenomena, the contributions of Gestalt psychology include: (a) a unique theoretical framework and methodology, (b) a set of perceptual principles, (c) a well-known set of perceptual grouping laws, (d) a theory of problem solving based on insight, and (e) a theory of memory",3
"The following subsections discuss these contributions in turn    Theoretical framework and methodology   The Gestalt psychologists practiced a set of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological researchThis is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object",3
"The theoretical principles are the following:  Principle of totality—Conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a system of dynamic relationshipsWertheimer described holism as fundamental to Gestalt psychology, writing ""There are wholes, the behavior of which is not determined by that of their individual elements, but where the part-processes are themselves determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole."" In other words, a perceptual whole is different from what one would predict based on only its individual parts",3
"Moreover, the nature of a part depends upon the whole in which it is embeddedKöhler, for example, writes ""In psychology...we have wholes which, instead of being the sum of parts existing independently, give their parts specific functions or properties that can only be defined in relation to the whole in question."" Thus, the maxim that the whole is more than the sum of its parts is not a precise description of the Gestaltist view",3
"Rather, ""The whole is something else than the sum of its parts, because summing is a meaningless procedure, whereas the whole-part relationship is meaningful.""Principle of psychophysical isomorphism – Köhler hypothesized that there is a correlation between conscious experience and cerebral activity.Based on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:  Phenomenon experimental analysis—In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities",3
"Biotic experiment—The Gestalt psychologists established a need to conduct real experiments that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experimentsThis signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher fidelity, what would be habitual for a subject    Properties   The key principles of gestalt systems are emergence, reification, multistability and invariance     Reification     Reification is the constructive or generative aspect of perception, by which the experienced percept contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based",3
"For instance, a triangle is perceived in picture A, though no triangle is thereIn pictures B and D the eye recognizes disparate shapes as ""belonging"" to a single shape, in C a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawnReification can be explained by progress in the study of illusory contours, which are treated by the visual system as ""real"" contours     Multistability     Multistability (or multistable perception) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations",3
"This is seen, for example, in the Necker cube and Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion shown hereOther examples include the three-legged blivet and artist MCEscher's artwork and the appearance of flashing marquee lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the otherAgain, Gestalt psychology does not explain how images appear multistable, only that they do     Invariance     Invariance is the property of perception whereby simple geometrical objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features",3
"For example, the objects in A in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which is immediately distinguishable from the forms in BThey are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in C, and when depicted using different graphic elements as in DComputational theories of vision, such as those by David Marr, have provided alternate explanations of how perceived objects are classifiedEmergence, reification, multistability, and invariance are not necessarily separable modules to model individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified dynamic mechanism",3
    Figure-ground organization   The perceptual field (what an organism perceives) is organizedFigure-ground organization is one form of perceptual organizationFigure-ground organization is the interpretation of perceptual elements in terms of their shapes and relative locations in the layout of surfaces in the 3-D worldFigure-ground organization structures the perceptual field into a figure (standing out at the front of the perceptual field) and a background (receding behind the figure)Pioneering work on figure-ground organization was carried out by the Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin,3
"The Gestalt psychologists demonstrated that we tend to perceive as figures those parts of our perceptual fields that are convex, symmetric, small, and enclosed    Prägnanz    Like figure-ground organization, perceptual grouping (sometimes called perceptual segregation) is a form of perceptual organizationOrganisms perceive some parts of their perceptual fields as ""hanging together"" more tightly than othersThey use this information for object detectionPerceptual grouping is the process that determines what these ""pieces"" of the perceptual field are.The Gestaltists were the first psychologists to systematically study perceptual grouping",3
"According to Gestalt psychologists, the fundamental principle of perceptual grouping is the law of Prägnanz(The law of Prägnanz is also known as the law of good Gestalt.) Prägnanz is a German word that directly translates to ""pithiness"" and implies salience, conciseness, and orderlinessThe law of Prägnanz says that we tend to experience things as regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simpleAs Koffka put it, ""Of several geometrically possible organizations that one will actually occur which possesses the best, simplest and most stable shape.""The law of Prägnanz implies that, as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe reality in its most simplistic form",3
" Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relationsThe law of good Gestalt focuses on the idea of conciseness, which is what all of Gestalt theory is based on.A major aspect of Gestalt psychology is that it implies that the mind understands external stimuli as wholes rather than as the sums of their parts The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws",3
"Gestalt psychologists attempted to discover refinements of the law of Prägnanz, and this involved writing down laws that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what is often called ""gestalt laws""Wertheimer defined a few principles that explain the ways humans perceive objectsThose principles were based on similarity, proximity, continuityThe Gestalt concept is based on perceiving reality in its simplest form The various laws are called laws or principles, depending on the paper where they appear—but for simplicity's sake, this article uses the term laws",3
"These laws took several forms, such as the grouping of similar, or proximate, objects together, within this global processThese laws deal with the sensory modality of visionHowever, there are analogous laws for other sensory modalities including auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory (Bregman – GP) The visual Gestalt principles of grouping were introduced in Wertheimer (1923)Through the 1930s and 1940s Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka formulated many of the laws of grouping through the study of visual perception",3
"     Law of proximity     The law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group For example, in the figure illustrating the law of proximity, there are 72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groupsSpecifically, we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image",3
"This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated     Law of similarity     The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each otherThis similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualitiesFor example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square",3
"In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded lightWe perceive the dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together, forming six horizontal lines within the square of circlesThis perception of lines is due to the law of similarity     Law of closure     Gestalt psychologists believed that humans tend to perceive objects as complete rather than focusing on the gaps that the object might contain",3
"For example, a circle has good Gestalt in terms of completenessHowever, we will also perceive an incomplete circle as a complete circleThat tendency to complete shapes and figures is called closureThe law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not completeSpecifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap",3
"Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuliFor example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the imageHowever, gaps are present in the shapes If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures—but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes",3
"     Law of symmetry     The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center pointIt is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical partsTherefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shapeSimilarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical objectFor example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets",3
" When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets     Law of common fate    The law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest pathExperiments using the visual sensory modality found that the movement of elements of an object produces paths that individuals perceive that the objects are onWe perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on",3
"The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same pathFor example, if there are an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units     Law of continuity     The law of continuity (also known as the law of good continuation) states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object",3
"In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entitiesStimuli remain distinct even with overlapWe are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one objectFor example, the figure depicting the law of continuity shows a configuration of two crossed keysWhen the image is perceived, we tend to perceive the key in the background as a single uninterrupted key instead of two separate halves of a key",3
"     Law of past experience    The law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience If two objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived togetherFor example, the English language contains 26 letters that are grouped to form words using a set of rulesIf an individual reads an English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to interpret the letters ""L"" and ""I"" as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U",3
"     Music    An example of the Gestalt movement in effect, as it is both a process and result, is a music sequencePeople are able to recognise a sequence of perhaps six or seven notes, despite them being transposed into a different tuning or key    Problem solving and insight   Gestalt psychology contributed to the scientific study of problem solvingIn fact, the early experimental work of the Gestaltists in Germany marks the beginning of the scientific study of problem solving",3
"Later this experimental work continued through the 1960s and early 1970s with research conducted on relatively simple (but novel for participants) laboratory tasks of problem solving.Given Gestalt psychology's focus on the whole, it was natural for Gestalt psychologists to study problem-solving from the perspective of insight, seeking to understand the process by which organisms sometimes suddenly transition from having no idea how to solve a problem to instantly understanding the whole problem and its solution.: 13  In a famous set of experiments, Köhler gave chimpanzees some boxes and placed food high off the ground; after some time, the chimpanzees appeared to suddenly realize that they could stack the boxes on top of each other to reach the food.: 362 Max Wertheimer distinguished two kinds of thinking: productive thinking and reproductive thinking.: 456 : 361  Productive thinking is solving a problem based on insight—a quick, creative, unplanned response to situations and environmental interaction",3
"Reproductive thinking is solving a problem deliberately based on previous experience and knowledgeReproductive thinking proceeds algorithmically—a problem solver reproduces a series of steps from memory, knowing that they will lead to a solution—or by trial and error.: 361 Karl Duncker, another Gestalt psychologist who studied problem solving,: 370  coined the term functional fixedness for describing the difficulties in both visual perception and problem solving that arise from the fact that one element of a whole situation already has a (fixed) function that has to be changed in order to perceive something or find the solution to a problem.Abraham Luchins also studied problem solving from the perspective of Gestalt psychology",3
"He is well known for his research on the role of mental set (Einstellung effect), which he demonstrated using a series of problems having to do with refilling water jars.: 383 Another Gestalt psychologist, Perkins, believes insight deals with three processes:  Unconscious leap in thinkingThe increased amount of speed in mental processingThe amount of short-circuiting that occurs in normal reasoning.Views going against the Gestalt psychology are:  Nothing-special view Neo-gestalt view The Three-Process View     Fuzzy-trace theory of memory   Fuzzy-trace theory, a dual process model of memory and reasoning, was also derived from Gestalt psychology",3
"Fuzzy-trace theory posits that we encode information into two separate traces: verbatim and gistInformation stored in verbatim is exact memory for detail (the individual parts of a pattern, for example) while information stored in gist is semantic and conceptual (what we perceive the pattern to be)The effects seen in Gestalt psychology can be attributed to the way we encode information as gist    Legacy   Gestalt psychology struggled to precisely define terms like Prägnanz, to make specific behavioral predictions, and to articulate testable models of underlying neural mechanisms",3
"It was criticized as being merely descriptiveThese shortcomings led, by the mid-20th century, to growing dissatisfaction with Gestaltism and a subsequent decline in its impact on psychologyDespite this decline, Gestalt psychology has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects and of research into behavior, thinking, problem solving and psychopathology    Support from cybernetics and neurology   In the 1940s and 1950s, laboratory research in neurology and what became known as cybernetics on the mechanism of frogs' eyes indicate that perception of 'gestalts' (in particular gestalts in motion) is perhaps more primitive and fundamental than 'seeing' as such:  A frog hunts on land by vision..",3
"He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must center a part of the image..The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around himHe will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not movingHis choice of food is determined only by size and movementHe will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one",3
"He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object..He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.The lowest-level concepts related to visual perception for a human being probably differ little from the concepts of a frogIn any case, the structure of the retina in mammals and in human beings is the same as in amphibians",3
"The phenomenon of distortion of perception of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchyThis is a very interesting phenomenonWhen a person looks at an immobile object, ""fixes"" it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movementsAs a result, the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity",3
"The image ""marks time"" in the vicinity of this point.In the 1990s, Andranik Tangian developed a model of artificial perception that implemented a principle of correlativity, which operationalized the Gestalt psychology laws in their interactionThe model finds structures in data without knowing the structures, similarly to segregating elements in abstract painting—like curves, contours and spots—without identifying them with known objectsThe approach is based on the least complex data representations in the sense of Kolmogorov, i.e",3
"requiring the least memory storage, which is regarded as saving the brain energyThe least complexity criterion leads to multi-level data representations in terms of generative patterns and their transformations, using proximities, similarities, symmetries, common fate grouping, continuities, etcThe idea that perception is data representation rather than ""physical"" recognition is illustrated by the effect of several voices produced by a single physical body—a loudspeaker membrane, whereas the effect of a single tone is produced by several physical bodies—organ pipes tuned as a chord and activated by a single key",3
"It is shown that the physical causality in certain observations can be revealed through optimal data representations, and this nature–information duality is explained by the fact that both nature and information are subordinated to the same principle of efficiencyIn some situations, the least complex data representations use the patterns already stored in the memory, demonstrating the dependence of perception on previous knowledge—in line with the Gestalt psychology law of past experience",3
"Such an intelligent perception as opposed to the naïve perception that is based exclusively on direct percepts and is therefore context-dependentThe model is applied to automatic notation of music—recognition of interval structures in chords and polyphonic voices (with no reference to pitch, thereby relying on interval hearing instead of absolute hearing) as well as rhythms under variable tempo, approaching the capabilities of trained musiciansThe model is also relevant to visual scene analysis and explains some modes of abstract thinking",3
"    Quantum cognition modeling    Similarities between Gestalt phenomena and quantum mechanics have been pointed out by, among others, chemist Anton Amann, who commented that ""similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable"" yet may give useful insight nonethelessPhysicist Elio Conte and co-workers have proposed abstract, mathematical models to describe the time dynamics of cognitive associations with mathematical tools borrowed from quantum mechanics and has discussed psychology experiments in this context",3
"A similar approach has been suggested by physicists David Bohm, Basil Hiley and philosopher Paavo Pylkkänen with the notion that mind and matter both emerge from an ""implicate order""The models involve non-commutative mathematics; such models account for situations in which the outcome of two measurements performed one after the other can depend on the order in which they are performed—a pertinent feature for psychological processes, as an experiment performed on a conscious person may influence the outcome of a subsequent experiment by changing the state of mind of that person",3
"    Use in contemporary social psychology   The halo effect can be explained through the application of Gestalt theories to social information processingThe constructive theories of social cognition are applied though the expectations of individualsThey have been perceived in this manner and the person judging the individual is continuing to view them in this positive mannerGestalt's theories of perception enforces that individual's tendency to perceive actions and characteristics as a whole rather than isolated parts, therefore humans are inclined to build a coherent and consistent impression of objects and behaviors in order to achieve an acceptable shape and form",3
"The halo effect is what forms patterns for individuals, the halo effect being classified as a cognitive bias which occurs during impression formationThe halo effect can also be altered by physical characteristics, social status and many other characteristicsAs well, the halo effect can have real repercussions on the individual's perception of reality, either negatively or positively, meaning to construct negative or positive images about other individuals or situations, something that could lead to self-fulfilling prophesies, stereotyping, or even discrimination",3
"    Contemporary cognitive and perceptual psychology   Some of the central criticisms of Gestaltism are based on the preference Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideasThis is not necessarily a fair criticism as highlighted by a recent collection of quantitative research on Gestalt perceptionResearchers continue to test hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying Gestalt principles such as the principle of similarity.Other important criticisms concern the lack of definition and support for the many physiological assumptions made by gestaltists and lack of theoretical coherence in modern Gestalt psychology.In some scholarly communities, such as cognitive psychology and computational neuroscience, gestalt theories of perception are criticized for being descriptive rather than explanatory in nature",3
" For this reason, they are viewed by some as redundant or uninformativeFor example, a textbook on visual perception states that, ""The physiological theory of the gestaltists has fallen by the wayside, leaving us with a set of descriptive principles, but without a model of perceptual processingIndeed, some of their 'laws' of perceptual organisation today sound vague and inadequateWhat is meant by a 'good' or 'simple' shape, for example?""One historian of psychology, David J",3
"Murray, has argued that Gestalt psychologists first discovered many principles later championed by cognitive psychology, including schemas and prototypesAnother psychologist has argued that the Gestalt psychologists made a lasting contribution by showing how the study of illusions can help scientists understand essential aspects of how the visual system normally functions, not merely how it breaks down.: 16      Use in design   The gestalt laws are used in several visual design fields, such as user interface design and cartography",3
"The laws of similarity and proximity can, for example, be used as guides for placing radio buttonsThey may also be used in designing computers and software for more intuitive human useExamples include the design and layout of a desktop's shortcuts in rows and columns In map design, principles of Prägnanz or grouping are crucial for implying a conceptual order to the portrayed geographic features, thus facilitating the intended use of the map",3
"The Law of Similarity is employed by selecting similar map symbols for similar kinds of features or features with similar properties; the Law of Proximity is crucial to identifying geographic patterns and regions; and the Laws of Closure and Continuity allow users to recognize features that may be obscured by other features (such as when a road goes over a river)    See also       Notes       References    Heider, Grace M(1977)""More about Hull and Koffka""",3
"In psychology, the psyche  is the totality of the human mind, conscious and unconsciousCarl Jung also included in this definition the overlap and tension between the personal and the collective elements in man.Psychology is the scientific or objective study of the psycheThe word has a long history of use in psychology and philosophy, dating back to ancient times, and represents one of the fundamental concepts for understanding human nature from a scientific point of view",3
"The English word soul is sometimes used synonymously, especially in older texts    Etymology   The basic meaning of the Greek word ψυχή (psyche) was ""life"", although unsupported, some have claimed it is derived from the verb ψύχω (psycho, ""to blow"")Derived meanings included ""spirit"", ""soul"", ""ghost"", and ultimately ""self"" in the sense of ""conscious personality"" or ""psyche""    Ancient psychology   The idea of the psyche is central to the philosophy of PlatoScholars translate the Platonic conceptualization of the term as ""soul"" in the sense that he believed that it is immortal",3
"In his Phaedo, Plato has Socrates give four arguments for the immortality of the soul and life after death following the separation of the soul from the bodyPlato's Socrates also states that after death the Psyche is better able to achieve wisdom and experience the Platonic forms since it is unhindered by the body.The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote an influential treatise on the psyche, called in Greek Περὶ Ψυχῆς (Peri Psyches), in Latin De Anima and in English On the Soul",3
"In this work, he used the concept of the soul to explain certain functionsSince - for him - the soul is motion, it needs an explanatory principle for bodily motionAristotle's theory of the ""three souls (psyches)"" (vegetal, animal, and rational) would rule the field of psychology until the 19th centuryPrior to Aristotle, a number of Greek writings used the term psyche in a less precise senseIn late antiquity, Galenic medicine developed the idea of three ""spirits"" (pneuma) corresponding to Aristotle's three souls",3
"The pneuma psychikon corresponded to the rational soulThe other two pneuma were the pneuma physicon and the pneuma zoticon    Medieval psychology   The term psyche was Latinized to anima, which became one of the basic terms used in medieval psychologyAnima would have traditionally been rendered in English as ""soul"" but in modern usage the term ""psyche"" is preferable    Phenomenology   19th century psychologists such as Franz Brentano developed the concept of the psyche in a more subjective direction",3
"    Psychoanalysis   In psychoanalysis and other forms of depth psychology, the psyche refers to the forces in an individual that influence thought, behavior and personality    Freudian school    Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, believed that the psyche—he used the word Seele ('soul', but also 'psyche') throughout his writings—was composed of three components: The id, which represents the instinctual drives of an individual and remains largely unconsciousIt does not respect the rules of society",3

"As early as the 4th century BC, the Greek physician Hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causesIn 387 BCE, Plato suggested that the brain is where mental processes take place, and in 335 BCE Aristotle suggested that it was the heart.In China, psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of Laozi and Confucius, and later from the doctrines of BuddhismThis body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting",3

"In Germany, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuumHe suggested that the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degreeChristian Wolff identified psychology as its own science, writing Psychologia Empirica in 1732 and Psychologia Rationalis in 1734Immanuel Kant advanced the idea of anthropology as a discipline, with psychology an important subdivision",3
"Kant, however, explicitly rejected the idea of an experimental psychology, writing that ""the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.""

In Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt",3
"Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, where he established the psychological laboratory that brought experimental psychology to the worldWundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of materialsPaul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential laboratory at Leipzig, a psychology-related lab, that focused more on experimental psychiatry.The German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, a researcher at the University of Berlin, was another 19th-century contributor to the field",3
"He pioneered the experimental study of memory and developed quantitative models of learning and forgettingIn the early twentieth century, Wolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Koffka co-founded the school of Gestalt psychology (not to be confused with the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls)The approach of Gestalt psychology is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholesRather than reducing thoughts and behavior into smaller component elements, as in structuralism, the Gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important, and differs from the sum of its parts",3
"Psychologists in Germany, Denmark, Austria, England, and the United States soon followed Wundt in setting up laboratoriesGStanley Hall, an American who studied with Wundt, founded a psychology lab that became internationally influentialThe lab was located at Johns Hopkins UniversityHall, in turn, trained Yujiro Motora, who brought experimental psychology, emphasizing psychophysics, to the Imperial University of TokyoWundt's assistant, Hugo Münsterberg, taught psychology at Harvard to students such as Narendra Nath Sen Gupta—who, in 1905, founded a psychology department and laboratory at the University of Calcutta",3

"Experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities.Divisions still exist within the field, with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences of individual humans, which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger populationCritics inside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by a ""cult of empiricism,"" which limits the scope of research because investigators restrict themselves to methods derived from the physical sciences.: 36–7  Feminist critiques have argued that claims to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of (historically) mostly male researchers",3

"A leading question in behavioral neuroscience has been whether and how mental functions are localized in the brainFrom Phineas Gage to H.Mand Clive Wearing, individual people with mental deficits traceable to physical brain damage have inspired new discoveries in this areaModern behavioral neuroscience could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France Paul Broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function",3

"Behavioral researchers have developed a treatment known as behavior modification, which is used to help individuals replace undesirable behaviors with desirable ones  Early behavioral researchers studied stimulus–response pairings, now known as classical conditioningThey demonstrated that when a biologically potent stimulus (e.g., food that elicits salivation) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g., a bell) over several learning trials, the neutral stimulus by itself can come to elicit the response the biologically potent stimulus elicits",3

"A new method of ""instrumental"" or ""operant"" conditioning added the concepts of reinforcement and punishment to the model of behavior changeRadical behaviorists avoided discussing the inner workings of the mind, especially the unconscious mind, which they considered impossible to assess scientificallyOperant conditioning was first described by Miller and Kanorski and popularized in the U.Sby B.FSkinner, who emerged as a leading intellectual of the behaviorist movement.Noam Chomsky published an influential critique of radical behaviorism on the grounds that behaviorist principles could not adequately explain the complex mental process of language acquisition and language use",3

"Researchers in the field of cognitive psychology are sometimes called cognitivistsThey rely on an information processing model of mental functioningCognitivist research is informed by functionalism and experimental psychology Starting in the 1950s, the experimental techniques developed by Wundt, James, Ebbinghaus, and others re-emerged as experimental psychology became increasingly cognitivist and, eventually, constituted a part of the wider, interdisciplinary cognitive scienceSome called this development the cognitive revolution because it rejected the anti-mentalist dogma of behaviorism as well as the strictures of psychoanalysis.Albert Bandura helped along the transition in psychology from behaviorism to cognitive psychology",3

"Humanistic psychology also focuses on personal growth, self-identity, death, aloneness, and freedomIt emphasizes subjective meaning, the rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathologySome founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapyLater, positive psychology opened up humanistic themes to scientific studyPositive psychology is the study of factors which contribute to human happiness and well-being, focusing more on people who are currently healthy",3

"It stands for respect for the worth of persons, respect for differences of approach, open-mindedness as to acceptable methods, and interest in exploration of new aspects of human behaviorAs a ""third force"" in contemporary psychology, it is concerned with topics having little place in existing theories and systems: e.g., love, creativity, self, growth, organism, basic need-gratification, self-actualization, higher values, being, becoming, spontaneity, play, humor, affection, naturalness, warmth, ego-transcendence, objectivity, autonomy, responsibility, meaning, fair-play, transcendental experience, peak experience, courage, and related concepts",3

"Swiss psychoanalyst Ludwig Binswanger and American psychologist George Kelly may also be said to belong to the existential schoolExistential psychologists tend to differ from more ""humanistic"" psychologists in the former's relatively neutral view of human nature and relatively positive assessment of anxietyExistential psychologists emphasized the humanistic themes of death, free will, and meaning, suggesting that meaning can be shaped by myths and narratives; meaning can be deepened by the acceptance of free will, which is requisite to living an authentic life, albeit often with anxiety with regard to death.Austrian existential psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl drew evidence of meaning's therapeutic power from reflections upon his own internment",3

"According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the id, ego, and super-egoBy contrast, trait theorists have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key traitsTrait theorists have often employed statistical data-reduction methods, such as factor analysisAlthough the number of proposed traits has varied widely, Hans Eysenck's early biologically-based model suggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality, extraversion–introversion, neuroticism-stability, and psychoticism-normality",3
"Raymond Cattell empirically derived a theory of 16 personality factors at the primary-factor level and up to eight broader second-stratum factorsSince the 1980s, the Big Five (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) emerged as an important trait theory of personalityDimensional models of personality are receiving increasing support, and a version of dimensional assessment has been included in the DSM-VHowever, despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the ""Big Five"" personality dimensions, it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan.An early example of personality assessment was the Woodworth Personal Data Sheet, constructed during World War I",3
"The popular, although psychometrically inadequate, Myers–Briggs Type Indicator was developed to assess individuals' ""personality types"" according to the personality theories of Carl JungThe Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), despite its name, is more a dimensional measure of psychopathology than a personality measureCalifornia Psychological Inventory contains 20 personality scales (e.g., independence, tolerance)The International Personality Item Pool, which is in the public domain, has become a source of scales that can be used personality assessment",3
"    Unconscious mind    Study of the unconscious mind, a part of the psyche outside the individual's awareness but that is believed to influence conscious thought and behavior, was a hallmark of early psychologyIn one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States, C.SPeirce and Joseph Jastrow found in 1884 that research subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the differenceFreud popularized the concept of the unconscious mind, particularly when he referred to an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one's speech (a Freudian slip) or to his efforts to interpret dreams",3
"His 1901 book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life catalogues hundreds of everyday events that Freud explains in terms of unconscious influencePierre Janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the direct scrutiny of the subject.The concept of unconscious processes has remained important in psychologyCognitive psychologists have used a ""filter"" model of attentionAccording to the model, much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain stimuli, limited by their nature and number, make their way through the filter",3
"Much research has shown that subconscious priming of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behaviorBecause of the unreliability of self-reporting, a major hurdle in this type of research involves demonstrating that a subject's conscious mind has not perceived a target stimulusFor this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between implicit and explicit memoryIn another approach, one can also describe a subliminal stimulus as meeting an objective but not a subjective threshold.The automaticity model of John Bargh and others involves the ideas of automaticity and unconscious processing in our understanding of social behavior, although there has been dispute with regard to replication",3
"Some experimental data suggest that the brain begins to consider taking actions before the mind becomes aware of themThe influence of unconscious forces on people's choices bears on the philosophical question of free willJohn Bargh, Daniel Wegner, and Ellen Langer describe free will as an illusion    Motivation    Some psychologists study motivation or the subject of why people or lower animals initiate a behavior at a particular timeIt also involves the study of why humans and lower animals continue or terminate a behavior",3
"Psychologists such as William James initially used the term motivation to refer to intention, in a sense similar to the concept of will in European philosophyWith the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivationAccording to drive theory, the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influencePsychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as demands originating in the nervous system",3
"Psychoanalysts believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psycheClassical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle, roughly corresponding to id and egoLater, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud introduced the concept of the death drive, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic eventsMeanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking",3
"Clark Hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model.Hunger, thirst, fear, sexual desire, and thermoregulation constitute fundamental motivations in animalsHumans seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivations—though theoretically these could be explained as resulting from desires for belonging, positive self-image, self-consistency, truth, love, and control.Motivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different waysResearchers have found that eating, for example, depends not only on the organism's fundamental need for homeostasis—an important factor causing the experience of hunger—but also on circadian rhythms, food availability, food palatability, and cost",3
"Abstract motivations are also malleable, as evidenced by such phenomena as goal contagion: the adoption of goals, sometimes unconsciously, based on inferences about the goals of othersVohs and Baumeister suggest that contrary to the need-desire-fulfilment cycle of animal instincts, human motivations sometimes obey a ""getting begets wanting"" rule: the more you get a reward such as self-esteem, love, drugs, or money, the more you want itThey suggest that this principle can even apply to food, drink, sex, and sleep",3
"    Development psychology    Developmental psychology refers to the scientific study of how and why the thought processes, emotions, and behaviors of humans change over the course of their livesSome credit Charles Darwin with conducting the first systematic study within the rubric of developmental psychology, having published in 1877 a short paper detailing the development of innate forms of communication based on his observations of his infant sonThe main origins of the discipline, however, are found in the work of Jean Piaget",3
"Like Piaget, developmental psychologists originally focused primarily on the development of cognition from infancy to adolescenceLater, developmental psychology extended itself to the study cognition over the life spanIn addition to studying cognition, developmental psychologists have also come to focus on affective, behavioral, moral, social, and neural developmentDevelopmental psychologists who study children use a number of research methodsFor example, they make observations of children in natural settings such as preschools and engage them in experimental tasks",3
"Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically usefulDevelopmental researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infantsIn addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span, including old ageThese psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research    Genes and environment    All researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees",3
"These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals and familiesAn example of this confounding can be shown in the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspringA theory based on environmental transmission would hold that an offspring, by virtue of his or her having a problematic rearing environment managed by a depressed mother, is at risk for developing depressionOn the other hand, a hereditarian theory would hold that depression risk in an offspring is influenced to some extent by genes passed to the child from the mother",3
"Genes and environment in these simple transmission models are completely confoundedA depressed mother may both carry genes that contribute to depression in her offspring and also create a rearing environment that increases the risk of depression in her childBehavioral genetics researchers have employed methodologies that help to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behaviorTraditionally the research has involved twin studies and adoption studies, two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded",3
"More recently, gene-focused research has contributed to understanding genetic contributions to the development of psychological traitsThe availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome-wide association studiesOne goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in Huntington's: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype",3
"One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly polygenic, where a large number (on the order of hundreds to thousands) of genetic variants, each of small effect, contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorderActive research continues to work toward understanding the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction",3
"    Applications    Psychology encompasses many subfields and includes different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior    Psychological testing    Psychological testing has ancient origins, dating as far back as 2200 BC, in the examinations for the Chinese civil serviceWritten exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 200)By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topicsThe system was ended in 1906.: 41–2  In Europe, mental assessment took a different approach, with theories of physiognomy—judgment of character based on the face—described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece",3
"Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy.: 42–3  When experimental psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton was a leading practitionerBy virtue of his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, he is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as psychometrics).: 44–5  James McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the idea of psychological testing to the United States, and in fact coined the term ""mental test"".: 45–6  In 1901, Cattell's student Clark Wissler published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict academic performance.: 45–6  In response to 1904 orders from the Minister of Public Instruction, French psychologists Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon developed and elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905–1911",3
"They used a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficultyBinet and Simon introduced the concept of mental age and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as idiotsHenry HGoddard put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as imbecile and feeblemindedIn 1916, (after Binet's death), Stanford professor Lewis MTerman modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the Stanford–Binet scale) and introduced the intelligence quotient as a score report.: 50–56  Based on his test findings, and reflecting the racism common to that era, Terman concluded that intellectual disability ""represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes",3
"Their dullness seems to be racial.""Following the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests, which was developed by psychologist Robert Yerkes in 1917 and then used in World War 1 by industrial and organizational psychologists for large-scale employee testing and selection of military personnelMental testing also became popular in the U.S., where it was applied to schoolchildrenThe federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s",3
"In 1926, the College Entrance Examination Board created the Scholastic Aptitude Test to standardize college admissions.: 61  The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions, including the preferential training of Black Americans for manual laborThese practices were criticized by Black intellectuals such a Horace Mann Bond and Allison DavisEugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded (now referred to as intellectual disability)",3
"In the United States, tens of thousands of men and women were sterilizedSetting a precedent that has never been overturned, the U.SSupreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1927 case Buck vBell.Today mental testing is a routine phenomenon for people of all ages in Western societies.: 2  Modern testing aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure, consistency of results, output of an interpretable score, statistical norms describing population outcomes, and, ideally, effective prediction of behavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations.: 4–6  Developments in psychometrics include work on test and scale reliability and validity",3
"Developments in item-response theory, structural equation modeling, and bifactor analysis have helped in strengthening test and scale construction    Mental health care    The provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the U.SSometimes, however, members of the school psychology and counseling psychology professions engage in practices that resemble that of clinical psychologistsClinical psychologists typically include people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychologyIn Canada, some of the members of the abovementioned groups usually fall within the larger category of professional psychology",3
"In Canada and the U.S., practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates; doctoral students in clinical psychology usually spend one year in a predoctoral internship and one year in postdoctoral internshipIn Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctoral degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high schoolClinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychologyIt includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychological distress, dysfunction, and/or mental illness",3
"Clinical psychologists also try to promote subjective well-being and personal growthCentral to the practice of clinical psychology are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.Credit for the first psychology clinic in the United States typically goes to Lightner Witmer, who established his practice in Philadelphia in 1896Another modern psychotherapist was Morton Prince, an early advocate for the establishment of psychology as a clinical and academic discipline",3
"In the first part of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by psychiatrists, who are medical doctorsPsychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve the diagnosis of mental problemsFor their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy to understand and treat the mentally ill.Psychotherapy as conducted by psychiatrists blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of community mental health facilities",3
"Some in the clinical psychology community adopted behavioral therapy, a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model that used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patientsA key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectivenessIn the 1970s, cognitive-behavior therapy emerged with the work of Albert Ellis and Aaron BeckAlthough there are similarities between behavior therapy and cognitive-behavior therapy, cognitive-behavior therapy required the application of cognitive constructsSince the 1970s, the popularity of cognitive-behavior therapy among clinical psychologists increased",3
"A key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.Mental health care today involves psychologists and social workers in increasing numbersIn 1977, National Institute of Mental Health director Bertram Brown described this shift as a source of ""intense competition and role confusion."" Graduate programs issuing doctorates in clinical psychology emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s",3
"The PhD degree is intended to train practitioners who could also conduct scientific researchThe PsyD degree is more exclusively designed to train practitioners.Some clinical psychologists focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injuryThis subspecialty is known as clinical neuropsychologyIn many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health professionThe emerging field of disaster psychology (see crisis intervention) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group)",3
"Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behavingFour major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential–humanistic, and systems or family therapyThere has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientationWith the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance",3
"Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an eclectic therapeutic orientation.Diagnosis in clinical psychology usually follows the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)The study of mental illnesses is called abnormal psychology    Education    Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizationsEducational psychologists can be found in preschools, schools of all levels including post secondary institutions, community organizations and learning centers, Government or private research firms, and independent or private consultant [[Madisonodell5/sandbox]]",3
"The work of developmental psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, and Jerome Bruner has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practicesEducational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America, Australia, and New ZealandSchool psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of gifted students; to facilitate prosocial behaviors in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning environments",3
"School psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment, intervention, prevention, and consultation, and many have extensive training in research    Work    Industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology involves research and practices that apply psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals' work-livesIn the field's beginnings, industrialists brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of scientific management techniques for improving workplace efficiencyThe field was at first called economic psychology or business psychology; later, industrial psychology, employment psychology, or psychotechnology",3
"An influential early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from 1924 to 1932Western Electric experimented on factory workers to assess their responses to changes in illumination, breaks, food, and wagesThe researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term Hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they're being watchedAlthough the Hawthorne research can be found in psychology textbooks, the research and its findings, however, were weak at best.The name industrial and organizational psychology emerged in the 1960s",3
"In 1973, it became enshrined in the name of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Division 14 of the American Psychological AssociationOne goal of the discipline is to optimize human potential in the workplacePersonnel psychology is a subfield of I/O psychologyPersonnel psychologists apply the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workersAnother subfield, organizational psychology, examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity",3
"Most I/O psychologists work outside of academia, for private and public organizations and as consultantsA psychology consultant working in business today might expect to provide executives with information and ideas about their industry, their target markets, and the organization of their company.Organizational behavior (OB) is an allied field involved in the study of human behavior within organizationsOne way to differentiate I/O psychology from OB is to note that I/O psychologists train in university psychology departments and OB specialists, in business schools",3
"    Military and intelligence   One role for psychologists in the military has been to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnelIn the U.S., this function began during World War I, when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military Psychology at Fort Oglethorpe in GeorgiaThe school provided psychological training for military staffToday, U.SArmy psychologists perform psychological screening, clinical psychotherapy, suicide prevention, and treatment for post-traumatic stress, as well as provide prevention-related services, for example, smoking cessation",3
"The United States Army's Mental Health Advisory Teams implement psychological interventions to help combat troops experiencing mental problems.Psychologists may also work on a diverse set of campaigns known broadly as psychological warfarePsychological warfare chiefly involves the use of propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civiliansThis so-called black propaganda is designed to seem as if it originates from a source other than the ArmyThe CIA's MKULTRA program involved more individualized efforts at mind control, involving techniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of LSD",3
"The U.Smilitary used the name Psychological Operations (PSYOP) until 2010, when these activities were reclassified as Military Information Support Operations (MISO), part of Information Operations (IO)Psychologists have sometimes been involved in assisting the interrogation and torture of suspects, staining the records of the psychologists involved    Health, well-being, and social change        Social change    An example of the contribution of psychologists to social change involves the research of Kenneth and Mamie Clark",3
"These two African American psychologists studied segregation's adverse psychological impact on Black childrenTheir research findings played a role in the desegregation case Brown vBoard of Education (1954).The impact of psychology on social change includes the discipline's broad influence on teaching and learningResearch has shown that compared to the ""whole word"" or ""whole language"" approach, the phonics approach to reading instruction is more efficacious     Medical applications    Medical facilities increasingly employ psychologists to perform various roles",3
One aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimenHealth psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliancePsychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behaviorThese range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policiesPsychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole populations of people,3
"     Worker health, safety and wellbeing    Psychologists work with organizations to apply findings from psychological research to improve the health and well-being of employeesSome work as external consultants hired by organizations to solve specific problems, whereas others are full-time employees of the organizationApplications include conducting surveys to identify issues and designing interventions to make work healthierSome of the specific health areas include:  Accidents and injuries: A major contribution is the concept of safety climate, which is employee shared perceptions of the behaviors that are encouraged (e.g., wearing safety gear) and discouraged (not following safety rules) at work",3
"Organizations with strong safety climates have fewer work accidents and injuriesCardiovascular disease: Cardiovascular disease has been related to lack of job controlMental health: Exposure to occupational stress is associated with mental health disorderMusculoskeletal disorder: These are injuries in bones, nerves and tendons due to overexertion and repetitive strainThey have been linked to job satisfaction and workplace stressPhysical health symptoms: Occupational stress has been linked to physical symptoms such as digestive distress and headache",3
"Workplace violence: Violence prevention climate is related to being physically assaulted and psychologically mistreated at work.Interventions that improve climates are a way to address accidents and violenceInterventions that reduce stress at work or provide employees with tools to better manage it can help in areas where stress is an important componentIndustrial psychology became interested in worker fatigue during World War I, when government ministers in Britain were concerned about the impact of fatigue on workers in munitions factories but not other types of factories",3
"In the UKsome interest in worker well-being emerged with the efforts of Charles Samuel Myers and his National Institute of Industrial Psychology (NIIP) during the inter-War yearsIn the USduring the mid-twentieth century industrial psychologist Arthur Kornhauser pioneered the study of occupational mental health, linking industrial working conditions to mental health as well as the spillover of an unsatisfying job into a worker's personal lifeZickar accumulated evidence to show that ""no other industrial psychologist of his era was as devoted to advocating management and labor practices that would improve the lives of working people.""      Occupational health psychology    As interest in the worker health expanded toward the end of the twentieth century, the field of occupational health psychology (OHP) emerged",3
"OHP is a branch of psychology that is interdisciplinaryOHP is concerned with the health and safety of workersOHP addresses topic areas such as the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health, mistreatment of workers (e.g., bullying and violence), work-family balance, the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health, the influence of psychosocial factors on safety and accidents, and interventions designed to improve/protect worker healthOHP grew out of  health psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, and occupational medicine",3
"OHP has also been informed by disciplines outside psychology, including industrial engineering, sociology, and economics    Research methods    Quantitative psychological research lends itself to the statistical testing of hypothesesAlthough the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomenaSome psychologists rely on less rigorously controlled, but more ecologically valid, field experiments as wellOther research psychologists rely on statistical methods to glean knowledge from population data",3
"The statistical methods research psychologists employ include the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modelingThe measurement and operationalization of important constructs is an essential part of these research designsAlthough this type of psychological research is much less abundant than quantitative research, some psychologists conduct qualitative researchThis type of research can involve interviews, questionnaires, and first-hand observation",3
"While hypothesis testing is rare, virtually impossible, in qualitative research, qualitative studies can be helpful in theory and hypothesis generation, interpreting seemingly contradictory quantitative findings, and understanding why some interventions fail and others succeed    Controlled experiments    A true experiment with random assignment of research participants (sometimes called subjects) to rival conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationshipsWhen there are large numbers of research participants, the random assignment (also called random allocation) of those participants to rival conditions ensures that the individuals in those conditions will, on average, be similar on most characteristics, including characteristics that went unmeasured",3
"In an experiment, the researcher alters one or more variables of influence, called independent variables, and measures resulting changes in the factors of interest, called dependent variablesPrototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environmentA quasi-experiment refers to a situation in which there are rival conditions under study but random assignment to the different conditions is not possibleInvestigators must work with preexisting groups of people",3
"Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's validityFor example, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignmentsPsychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes and, perhaps, statistically adjust for any initial differences in reading level",3
"Experimental researchers typically use a statistical hypothesis testing model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing how well the data collected are consistent with the predictionsThese predictions are likely to originate from one or more abstract scientific hypotheses about how the phenomenon under study actually works    Other types of studies   Surveys are used in psychology for the purpose of measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, and checking the validity of experimental manipulations (checking research participants' perception of the condition they were assigned to)",3
"Psychologists have commonly used paper-and-pencil surveysHowever, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mailWeb-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjectsObservational studies are commonly conducted in psychologyIn cross-sectional observational studies, psychologists collect data at a single point in timeThe goal of many cross-sectional studies is the assess the extent factors are correlated with each otherBy contrast, in longitudinal studies psychologists collect data on the same sample at two or more points in time",3
"Sometimes the purpose of longitudinal research is to study trends across time such as the stability of traits or age-related changes in behaviorBecause some studies involve endpoints that psychologists cannot ethically study from an experimental standpoint, such as identifying the causes of depression, they conduct longitudinal studies a large group of depression-free people, periodically assessing what is happening in the individuals' livesIn this way psychologists have an opportunity to test causal hypotheses regarding conditions that commonly arise in people's lives that put them at risk for depression",3
"Problems that affect longitudinal studies include selective attrition, the type of problem in which bias is introduced when a certain type of research participant disproportionately leaves a studyExploratory data analysis refers to a variety of practices that researchers use to reduce a great many variables to a small number overarching factorsIn Peirce's three modes of inference, exploratory data analysis corresponds to abductionMeta-analysis is the technique research psychologists use to integrate results from many studies of the same variables and arriving at a grand average of the findings",3
"    Direct brain observation/manipulaiton    A classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the electroencephalogram (EEG), a technique using amplified electrodes on a person's scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brainHans Berger, the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature ""brain waves"": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousnessResearchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the delta wave observed during non-REM sleep.Newer functional neuroimaging techniques include functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, both of which track the flow of blood through the brain",3
"These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appealThey also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reportingIt remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate—or even how usefully such localization corresponds with realityHowever, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brainSome of these draw on a systemic neural network model rather than a localized function model.Psychiatric interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and drugs also provide information about brain–mind interactions",3
"Psychopharmacology is the study of drug-induced mental effects    Computer simulation    Computational modeling is a tool used in mathematical psychology and cognitive psychology to simulate behaviorThis method has several advantagesSince modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical powerModeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a humanComputational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain",3
"Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rulesOther types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling    Animal studies    Animal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a fewIn the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioningNon-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, and rats and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments",3
"Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variablesThese conditions are approximated best in laboratory settingsIn contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjectsThere are pitfalls, however, in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.Comparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior",3
"Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primatesIt is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as ethologyResearch in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the Sociobiology of E.OWilsonAnimal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g",3
"in cognitive neuroscience    Qualitative research   Qualitative research is often designed to answer questions about the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individualsQualitative research involving first-hand observation can help describe events as they occur, with the goal of capturing the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations are madeQualitative psychological research methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation",3
"Creswell (2003) identified five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, ethnography, case study, and grounded theoryQualitative researchers sometimes aim to enrich our understanding of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structuresSometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's application of psychological and sociological theories, in his book Escape from Freedom, to understanding why many ordinary Germans supported Hitler Just as Jane Goodall studied chimpanzee social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field, psychologists conduct naturalistic observation of ongoing human social, professional, and family life",3
"Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observedStrict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out    Program evaluation   Program evaluation involves the systematic collection, analysis, and application of information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs, particularly about their effectivenessIn both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know the extent which the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving, or objecting to are producing the intended effects",3
"While program evaluation first focuses on effectiveness, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful    Contemporary issues in methodology and practice       Metascience   Metascience involves the application of scientific methodology to study science itselfThe field of metascience has revealed problems in psychological research",3
"Some psychological research has suffered from bias, problematic reproducibility, and misuse of statisticsThese findings have led to calls for reform from within and from outside the scientific community     Confirmation bias    In 1959, statistician Theodore Sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that 97% of them supported their initial hypotheses, implying possible publication biasSimilarly, Fanelli (2010) found that 91.5% of psychiatry/psychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for, and concluded that the odds of this happening (a positive result) was around five times higher than in fields such as space science or geosciences",3
"Fanelli argued that this is because researchers in ""softer"" sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases     Replication     A replication crisis in psychology has emergedMany notable findings in the field have not been replicatedSome researchers were even accused of publishing fraudulent resultsSystematic efforts, including efforts by the Reproducibility Project of the Center for Open Science, to assess the extent of the problem found that as many as two-thirds of highly publicized findings in psychology failed to be replicated",3
"Reproducibility has generally been stronger in cognitive psychology (in studies and journals) than social psychology and subfields of differential psychologyOther subfields of psychology have also been implicated in the replication crisis, including clinical psychology, developmental psychology, and a field closely related to psychology,  educational research.Focus on the replication crisis has led to other renewed efforts in the discipline to re-test important findingsIn response to concerns about publication bias and data dredging (conducting a large number of statistical tests on a great many variables but restricting reporting to the results that were statistically significant), 295 psychology and medical journals have adopted result-blind peer review where studies are accepted not on the basis of their findings and after the studies are completed, but before the studies are conducted and upon the basis of the methodological rigor of their experimental designs and the theoretical justifications for their proposed statistical analysis before data collection or analysis is conducted",3
"In addition, large-scale collaborations among researchers working in multiple labs in different countries have taken placeThe collaborators regularly make their data openly available for different researchers to assessAllen et alestimated that 61 percent of result-blind studies have yielded null results, in contrast to an estimated 5 to 20 percent in traditional research     Misuse of statistics     Some critics view statistical hypothesis testing as misplacedPsychologist and statistician Jacob Cohen wrote in 1994 that psychologists routinely confuse statistical significance with practical importance, enthusiastically reporting great certainty in unimportant facts",3
"Some psychologists have responded with an increased use of effect size statistics, rather than sole reliance on p-values    WEIRD bias    In 2008, Arnett pointed out that most articles in American Psychological Association journals were about U.Spopulations when U.Scitizens are only 5% of the world's populationHe complained that psychologists had no basis for assuming psychological processes to be universal and generalizing research findings to the rest of the global population",3
"In 2010, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan reported a bias in conducting psychology studies with participants from ""WEIRD"" (""Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic"") societiesHenrich et alfound that ""96% of psychological samples come from countries with only 12% of the world’s population"" (p63)The article gave examples of results that differ significantly between people from WEIRD and tribal cultures, including the Müller-Lyer illusionArnett (2008), Altmaier, and Hall (2008) and Morgan-Consoli et al",3
"(2018) view the Western bias in research and theory as a serious problem considering psychologists are increasingly applying psychological principles developed in WEIRD regions in their research, clinical work, and consultation with populations around the worldIn 2018, Rad, Martingano, and Ginges showed that nearly a decade after Henrich et al.'s paper, over 80% of the samples used in studies published in the journal Psychological Science employed WEIRD samplesMoreover, their analysis showed that several studies did not fully disclose the origin of their samples; the authors offered a set of recommendations to editors and reviewers to reduce WEIRD bias",3
"    Unscientific mental health training   Some observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its application—in particular, the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practicesCritics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competencePractices such as ""facilitated communication for infantile autism""; memory-recovery techniques including body work; and other therapies, such as rebirthing and reparenting, may be dubious or even dangerous, despite their popularity",3
"These practices, however, are outside the mainstream practices taught in clinical psychology doctoral programs    Ethics   Ethical standards in the discipline have changed over timeSome famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of established codes (the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the Belmont Report)The American Psychological Association has advanced a set of ethical principles and a code of conduct for the profession.The most important contemporary standards include informed and voluntary consent",3
"After World War II, the Nuremberg Code was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjectsLater, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the Declaration of HelsinkiIn the U.S., the National Institutes of Health established the Institutional Review Board in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the National Research Act (HR 7724)All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studiesA number of influential but ethically dubious studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the MIT-Harvard Fernald School radioisotope studies, the Thalidomide tragedy, the Willowbrook hepatitis study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority",3
"    Humans   Universities have ethics committees dedicated to protecting the rights (e.g., voluntary nature of the research, privacy) and well-being (e.g., minimizing distress) of research participantsUniversity ethics committees evaluate proposed research to ensure that researchers protect the rights and well-being of participants; an investigator's research project cannot be conducted unless approved by such an ethics committee.The ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as ""Ethical Standards of Psychologists""This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states",3
"It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoptionIn 1989, the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade CommissionThe 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between ""aspirational"" ethical standards and ""enforceable"" onesMembers of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.Some of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them",3
"Another important principle is informed consent, the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoingSome of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct    Other animals   Research on other animals is also governed by university ethics committeesResearch on nonhuman animals cannot proceed without permission of the ethics committee of the researcher's home institutionCurrent ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research",3
"Keeping this in mind, psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans Comparative psychologist Harry Harlow drew moral condemnation for isolation experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 1970sThe aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depressionHarlow also devised what he called a ""rape rack"", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture",3
"In 1974, American literary critic Wayne CBooth wrote that, ""Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance—that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties.""

"Social psychology is the scientific study of how the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals are influenced by the actual, imagined, and implied presence of others, 'imagined' and 'implied presences' referring to the internalized social norms that humans are influenced by even when they are alone.Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as being a result of the relationship between mental state and social situation, studying the conditions under which thoughts, feelings, and behaviors occur and how these variables influence social interactions",3
"Social psychology has bridged the gap between psychology and sociology to an extent, but a divide still exists between the two fieldsNevertheless, sociological approaches to psychology remain an important counterpart to conventional psychological researchIn addition to the split between psychology and sociology, there is a difference in emphasis between American and European social psychologists, as the former traditionally have focused more on the individual, whereas the latter have generally paid more attention to group-level phenomena",3
"    History   Although issues in social psychology already had been discussed in philosophy for much of human history—such as the writings of the Islamic philosopher Al-Farabi, which dealt with similar issues—the modern, scientific discipline began in the United States when the American Sociological Association (ASA) was founded in 1905    19th century   In the 19th century, social psychology was an emerging field from the larger field of psychologyAt the time, many psychologists were concerned with developing concrete explanations for the different aspects of human nature",3
"They attempted to discover concrete cause-and-effect relationships that explained social interactionsIn order to do so, they applied the scientific method to human behaviorThe first published study in the field was Norman Triplett's 1898 experiment on the phenomenon of social facilitationThese psychological experiments later went on to form the foundation of much of 20th century social psychological findings    Early 20th century   During the 1930s, many Gestalt psychologists, most notably Kurt Lewin, fled to the United States from Nazi Germany",3
"They were instrumental in developing the field as an area separate from the dominant behavioral and psychoanalytic schools of that timeAttitudes and small group phenomena were the topics most commonly studied in this era.During World War II, social psychologists were mostly concerned with studies of persuasion and propaganda for the U.Smilitary (see also psychological warfare)Following the war, researchers became interested in a variety of social problems, including issues of gender and racial prejudice",3
"Most notable and contentious of these were the Milgram experimentsDuring the years immediately following World War II, there were frequent collaborations between psychologists and sociologistsThe two disciplines, however, have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years, with sociologists generally focusing on macro features whereas psychologists generally focusing on more micro features    Late 20th century and modernity   In the 1960s, there was growing interest in topics such as cognitive dissonance, bystander intervention, and aggression",3
"By the 1970s, however, social psychology in America had reached a crisis, as heated debates emerged over issues such as ethical concerns about laboratory experimentation, whether attitude could actually predict behavior, and how much science could be done in a cultural contextThis was also a time when situationism came to challenge the relevance of self and personality in psychology.Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, social psychology reached a more mature level, especially in regard to theory and methodology",3
"Now, careful ethical standards regulate research, and pluralistic and multicultural perspectives have emergedModern researchers are interested in many phenomena, though attribution, social cognition, and the self-concept are perhaps the areas of greatest growth in recent yearsSocial psychologists have also maintained their applied interests with contributions in the social psychology of health, education, law, and the workplace    Intrapersonal phenomena       Attitudes    In social psychology, attitude is defined as learned, global evaluations (e.g",3
"of people or issues) that influence thought and actionAttitudes are basic expressions of approval and disapproval, or as Bem (1970) suggests, likes and dislikes (e.genjoying chocolate ice cream, or endorsing the values of a particular political party)Because people are influenced by other factors in any given situation, general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behaviorFor example, a person may value the environment but may not recycle a plastic bottle on a particular day",3
"Research on attitudes has examined the distinction between traditional, self-reported attitudes and implicit, unconscious attitudesExperiments using the implicit association test, for instance, have found that people often demonstrate implicit bias against other races, even when their explicit responses profess equal mindednessLikewise, one study found that in interracial interactions, explicit attitudes correlate with verbal behavior while implicit attitudes correlate with nonverbal behavior.One hypothesis on how attitudes are formed, first proposed in 1983 by Abraham Tesser, is that strong likes and dislikes are ingrained in our genetic make-up",3
"Tesser speculated that individuals are disposed to hold certain strong attitudes as a result of inborn personality traits and physical, sensory, and cognitive skillsAttitudes are also formed as a result of exposure to different experiences, environments, and the learning processNumerous studies have shown that people can form strong attitudes toward neutral objects that are in some way linked to emotionally charged stimuli.: 185–186 Attitudes are also involved in several other areas of the discipline, such as conformity, interpersonal attraction, social perception, and prejudice",3
"    Persuasion    Persuasion is an active method of influencing that attempts to guide people toward the adoption of an attitude, idea, or behavior by rational or emotive meansPersuasion relies on appeals rather than strong pressure or coercionThe process of persuasion has been found to be influenced by numerous variables that generally fall into one of five major categories: Communicator: includes credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractivenessMessage: includes varying degrees of reason, emotion (e.g",3
"fear), one-sided or two-sided arguments, and other types of informational contentAudience: includes a variety of demographics, personality traits, and preferencesChannel/medium: includes printed word, radio, television, the internet, or face-to-face interactionsContext: includes environment, group dynamics, and preliminary information to that of Message (category #2).Dual-process theories of persuasion (such as the elaboration likelihood model) maintain that persuasion is mediated by two separate routes: central and peripheralThe central route of persuasion is more fact-based and results in longer-lasting change, but requires motivation to process",3
"The peripheral route is more superficial and results in shorter-lasting change, but does not require as much motivation to processAn example of peripheral persuasion is a politician using a flag lapel pin, smiling, and wearing a crisp, clean shirtThis does not require motivation to be persuasive, but should not last as long as central persuasionIf that politician were to outline what they believe and their previous voting record, he would be centrally persuasive, resulting in longer-lasting change at the expense of greater motivation required for processing",3
"    Social cognition    Social cognition studies how people perceive, think about, and remember information about othersMuch research rests on the assertion that people think about other people differently from non-social targetsThis assertion is supported by the social-cognitive deficits exhibited by people with Williams syndrome and autismPerson perception is the study of how people form impressions of othersThe study of how people form beliefs about each other while interacting is interpersonal perception",3
"A major research topic in social cognition is attributionAttributions are how we explain people's behavior, either our own behavior or the behavior of othersOne element of attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to internal and external factorsAn internal, or dispositional, attribution reasons that behavior is caused by inner traits such as personality, disposition, character, and abilityAn external, or situational, attribution reasons that behaviour is caused by situational elements such as the weather.: 111  A second element of attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to stable and unstable factors (i.e",3
"whether the behavior will be repeated or changed under similar circumstances)Individuals also attribute causes of behavior to controllable and uncontrollable factors (i.ehow much control one has over the situation at hand)Numerous biases in the attribution process have been discoveredFor instance, the fundamental attribution error is the tendency to make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of the situational.: 724  The actor-observer bias is a refinement of this; it is the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for our own.: 107  The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened",3
"This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations.: 109  Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions that explain our behavior in ways that defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.: 111  Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality as measured by the opinions of others",3
"     Heuristics    Heuristics are cognitive shortcutsInstead of weighing all the evidence when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energyThe availability heuristic occurs when people estimate the probability of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagineAs such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias",3
"The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of.: 63  Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchersThe hindsight bias is a false memory of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcomeThe confirmation bias is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions",3
"     Schemas    Another key concept in social cognition is the assumption that reality is too complex to easily discernAs a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of realitySchemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processingSchemas often operate automatically and unintentionally and can lead to biases in perception and memorySchemas may induce expectations that lead us to see something that is not there",3
"One experiment found that people are more likely to misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white manThis type of schema is a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error)Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination)Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts",3
"    Self-concept    Self-concept is the whole sum of beliefs that people have about themselvesThe self-concept is made up of cognitive aspects called self-schemas—beliefs that people have about themselves and that guide the processing of self-referential informationFor example, an athlete at a university would have multiple selves that would process different information pertinent to each self: the student would be oneself, who would process information pertinent to a student (taking notes in class, completing a homework assignment, etc.); the athlete would be the self who processes information about things related to being an athlete (recognizing an incoming pass, aiming a shot, etc.)",3
"These selves are part of one's identity and the self-referential information is that which relies on the appropriate self to process and react to itIf a self is not part of one's identity, then it is much more difficult for one to reactFor example, a civilian may not know how to handle a hostile threat as well as a trained Marine wouldThe Marine contains a self that would enable him/her to process the information about the hostile threat and react accordingly, whereas a civilian may not contain that self, lessening the civilian's ability to properly assess the threat and act accordingly",3
"The self-concept comprises multiple self-schemasFor example, people whose body image is a significant self-concept aspect are considered schematics with respect to weightIn contrast, people who do not regard their weight as an important part of their lives are aschematic with respect to that attributeFor individuals, a range of otherwise mundane events—grocery shopping, new clothes, eating out, or going to the beach—can trigger thoughts about the self.The self is a special object of our attention",3
"Whether one is mentally focused on a memory, a conversation, a foul smell, the song that is stuck in one's head, or this sentence, consciousness is like a spotlightThis spotlight can shine on only one object at a time, but it can switch rapidly from one object to anotherIn this spotlight the self is front and center: things relating to the self have the spotlight more often.The ABCs of self are:: 53  Affect (i.e",3
"emotion): How do people evaluate themselves, enhance their self-image, and maintain a secure sense of identity? Behavior: How do people regulate their own actions and present themselves to others according to interpersonal demands? Cognition: How do individuals become themselves, build a self-concept, and uphold a stable sense of identity?Affective forecasting is the process of predicting how one would feel in response to future emotional eventsStudies done in 2003 by Timothy Wilson and Daniel Gilbert have shown that people overestimate the strength of their reactions to anticipated positive and negative life events, more than they actually feel when the event does occur.There are many theories on the perception of our own behavior",3
"Leon Festinger's 1954 social comparison theory is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinionsDaryl Bem's 1972 self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their own behaviorThere is also the facial feedback hypothesis: changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion.: 56 The self-concept is often divided into a cognitive component, known as the self-schema, and an evaluative component, the self-esteem",3
"The need to maintain a healthy self-esteem is recognized as a central human motivation.Self-efficacy beliefs are associated with the self-schemaThese are expectations that performance of some task will be effective and successfulSocial psychologists also study such self-related processes as self-control and self-presentation.People develop their self-concepts by various means, including introspection, feedback from others, self-perception, and social comparisonBy comparing themselves to others, people gain information about themselves, and they make inferences that are relevant to self-esteem",3
"Social comparisons can be either upward or downward, that is, comparisons to people who are either higher or lower in status or abilityDownward comparisons are often made in order to elevate self-esteem.Self-perception is a specialized form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behaviorPsychologists have found that too many extrinsic rewards (e.gmoney) tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process, a phenomenon known as overjustification",3
"People's attention is directed to the reward, and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offeredThis is an important exception to reinforcement theory    Interpersonal phenomena       Social influence    Social influence is an overarching term that denotes the persuasive effects people have on each otherIt is seen as a fundamental value in social psychologyThe study of it overlaps considerably with research into attitudes and persuasionThe three main areas of social influence include conformity, compliance, and obedience",3
"Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most effects of influence are strongest when they take place in social groupsThe first major area of social influence is conformityConformity is defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a groupThe identity of members within a group (i.estatus), similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual",3
"Individual variations among group members play a key role in the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform.: 27  Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.: 15   The second major area of social influence research is compliance, which refers to any change in behavior that is due to a request or suggestion from another person",3
"The foot-in-the-door technique is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with requesting a larger favor, e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollarsA related trick is the bait and switch.The third major form of social influence is obedience; this is a change in behavior that is the result of a direct order or command from another personObedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the Milgram study, wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.: 41 An unusual kind of social influence is the self-fulfilling prophecy",3
"This is a prediction that, in being made, causes itself to become trueFor example, in the stock market, if it is widely believed that a crash is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of their stock, and thus cause a crashSimilarly, people may expect hostility in others and induce this hostility by their own behavior.: 18 Psychologists have spent decades studying the power of social influence, and the way in which it manipulates people's opinions and behavior",3
"Specifically, social influence refers to the way in which individuals change their ideas and actions to meet the demands of a social group, received authority, social role, or a minority within a group wielding influence over the majority    Group dynamics    A group can be defined as two or more individuals who are connected to each other by social relationshipsGroups tend to interact, influence each other, and share a common identityThey have a number of emergent qualities that distinguish them from coincidental, temporary gatherings, which are termed social aggregates: Norms: Implicit rules and expectations for group members to follow (e.g",3
"saying thank you, shaking hands)Roles: Implicit rules and expectations for specific members within the group (e.gthe oldest sibling, who may have additional responsibilities in the family)Relations: Patterns of liking within the group, and also differences in prestige or status (e.gleaders, popular people).Temporary groups and aggregates share few or none of these features and do not qualify as true social groupsPeople waiting in line to get on a bus, for example, do not constitute a group.Groups are important not only because they offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept",3
"To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their social identityThe shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, which denotes the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each otherThese perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groupsThe tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group",3
"On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity that strengthens societyIntergroup discrimination leads to prejudicial stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and group polarization encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-groupGroups often moderate and improve decision making, and are frequently relied upon for these benefits, such as in committees and juriesA number of group biases, however, can interfere with effective decision making",3
"For example, group polarization, formerly known as the ""risky shift"", occurs when people polarize their views in a more extreme direction after group discussionMore problematic is the phenomenon of groupthink, which is a collective thinking defect that is characterized by a premature consensus or an incorrect assumption of consensus, caused by members of a group failing to promote views that are not consistent with the views of other membersGroupthink occurs in a variety of situations, including isolation of a group and the presence of a highly directive leader",3
"Janis offered the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion as a historical case of groupthink.Groups also affect performance and productivitySocial facilitation, for example, is a tendency to work harder and faster in the presence of othersSocial facilitation increases the dominant response's likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasksIn contrast, social loafing is the tendency of individuals to slack off when working in a group",3
"Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.Social psychologists study group-related (collective) phenomena such as the behavior of crowdsAn important concept in this area is deindividuation, a reduced state of self-awareness that can be caused by feelings of anonymityDeindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behaviorIt is common in crowds and mobs, but it can also be caused by a disguise, a uniform, alcohol, dark environments, or online anonymity",3
"    Interpersonal attraction    A major area of study of people's relations to each other is interpersonal attraction, which refers to all forces that lead people to like each other, establish relationships, and (in some cases) fall in loveSeveral general principles of attraction have been discovered by social psychologistsOne of the most important factors in interpersonal attraction is how similar two particular people areThe more similar two people are in general attitudes, backgrounds, environments, worldviews, and other traits, the more likely they will be attracted to each other.Physical attractiveness is an important element of romantic relationships, particularly in the early stages characterized by high levels of passion",3
"Later on, similarity and other compatibility factors become more important, and the type of love people experience shifts from passionate to companionateIn 1986, Robert Sternberg suggested that there are actually three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitmentWhen two (or more) people experience all three, they are said to be in a state of consummate loveAccording to social exchange theory, relationships are based on rational choice and cost-benefit analysis",3
"A person may leave a relationship if their partner's ""costs"" begin to outweigh their benefits, especially if there are good alternatives availableThis theory is similar to the minimax principle proposed by mathematicians and economists (despite the fact that human relationships are not zero-sum games)With time, long-term relationships tend to become communal rather than simply based on exchange    Research       Methods   Social psychology is an empirical science that attempts to answer questions about human behavior by testing hypotheses, both in the laboratory and in the field",3
"Careful attention to research design, sampling, and statistical analysis is important; results are published in peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin and the Journal of Personality and Social PsychologySocial psychology studies also appear in general science journals such as Psychological Science and ScienceExperimental methods involve the researcher altering a variable in the environment and measuring the effect on another variableAn example would be allowing two groups of children to play violent or nonviolent video games and then observing their subsequent level of aggression during the free-play period",3
"A valid experiment is controlled and uses random assignmentCorrelational methods examine the statistical association between two naturally occurring variablesFor example, one could correlate the number of violent television shows children watch at home with the number of violent incidents the children participate in at schoolNote that this study would not prove that violent TV causes aggression in children: it is quite possible that aggressive children choose to watch more violent TV",3
"Observational methods are purely descriptive and include naturalistic observation, contrived observation, participant observation, and archival analysisThese are less common in social psychology but are sometimes used when first investigating a phenomenonAn example would be to unobtrusively observe children on a playground (with a videocamera, perhaps) and record the number and types of aggressive actions displayedWhenever possible, social psychologists rely on controlled experimentation, which requires the manipulation of one or more independent variables in order to examine the effect on a dependent variable",3
"Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in internal validity, meaning that they are free from the influence of confounding or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationshipHowever, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in external validity, or the degree to which the results can be generalized to the larger populationThere is usually a trade-off between experimental control (internal validity) and being able to generalize to the population (external validity)",3
"Because it is usually impossible to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a sample of persons from the wider populationSocial psychologists frequently use survey research when they are interested in results that are high in external validitySurveys use various forms of random sampling to obtain a sample of respondents that is representative of a populationThis type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables",3
"Some psychologists have raised concerns for social psychological research relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings, or participants from crowdsourcing labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical TurkIn a 1986 study by David OSears, over 70% of experiments used North American undergraduates as subjects, a subset of the population that is unrepresentative of the population as a whole.Regardless of which method has been chosen, the significance of the results is reviewed before accepting them in evaluating an underlying hypothesis",3
"There are two different types of tests that social psychologists use to review their resultsStatistics and probability testing define what constitutes a significant finding, which can be as low as 5% or less, that is unlikely due to chanceReplications testing is important in ensuring that the results are valid and not due to chanceFalse positive conclusions, often resulting from the pressure to publish or the author's own confirmation bias, are a hazard in the field",3
"    Famous experiments        Asch conformity experiments     The Asch conformity experiments demonstrated the power of the impulse to conform within small groups, by the use of a line-length estimation task that was designed to be easy to assess but where deliberately wrong answers were given by at least some, oftentimes most, of the other participantsIn well over a third of the trials, participants conformed to the majority, even though the majority judgment was clearly wrong",3
"Seventy-five percent of the participants conformed at least once during the experimentAdditional manipulations of the experiment showed that participant conformity decreased when at least one other individual failed to conform but increased when the individual began conforming or withdrew from the experimentAlso, participant conformity increased substantially as the number of ""incorrect"" individuals increased from one to three, and remained high as the incorrect majority grewParticipants with three other, incorrect participants made mistakes 31.8% of the time, while those with one or two incorrect participants made mistakes only 3.6% and 13.6% of the time, respectively",3
"     Festinger (cognitive dissonance)     In Leon Festinger's cognitive dissonance experiment, after being divided into two groups participants were asked to perform a boring task and later asked to dishonestly give their opinion of the task, afterwards being rewarded according to two different pay scalesAt the study's end, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants were paid $20 to tell the same lie",3
The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20)Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonanceThey could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the taskBeing paid $20 provides a reason for doing the boring task resulting in no dissonance,3
"     Milgram experiment     The Milgram experiment was designed to study how far people would go in obeying an authority figureFollowing the events of The Holocaust in World War II, the experiment showed that normal American citizens were capable of following orders even when they believed they were causing an innocent person to suffer or even apparently die     Stanford prison experiment     Philip Zimbardo's Stanford prison study, a simulated exercise involving students playing at being prison guards and inmates, ostensibly showed how far people would go in such role playing",3
"In just a few days, the guards became brutal and cruel, and the prisoners became miserable and compliantThis was initially argued to be an important demonstration of the power of the immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traitsSubsequent research has contested the initial conclusions of the studyFor example, it has been pointed out that participant self-selection may have affected the participants' behavior, and that the participants' personalities influenced their reactions in a variety of ways, including how long they chose to remain in the study",3
"The 2002 BBC prison study, designed to replicate the conditions in the Stanford study, produced conclusions that were drastically different from the initial findings     Robber's cave experiment    Muzafer Sherif's robbers' cave study divided boys into two competing groups to explore how much hostility and aggression would emergeSherif's explanation of the results became known as realistic group conflict theory, because the intergroup conflict was induced through competition for resourcesInducing cooperation and superordinate goals later reversed this effect",3
"     Bandura's Bobo doll    Albert Bandura's Bobo doll experiment demonstrated how aggression is learned by imitation    Ethics   The goal of social psychology is to understand cognition and behavior as they naturally occur in a social context, but the very act of observing people can influence and alter their behaviorFor this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize deception to conceal or distort certain aspects of the studyDeception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and so on.The practice of deception has been challenged by psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical and that other research strategies (e.g., role-playing) should be used instead",3
"Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies, and this has cast doubt on their validityIn addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the Milgram experiment and Stanford prison experiment), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasonsTo protect the rights and well-being of research participants, and at the same time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an ethical review",3
"At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or Institutional Review Board, which examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to come to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking partFurthermore, a process of informed consent is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will be asked of them in the experiment and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time",3
"A debriefing is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the proceduresToday, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities    Adolescents   Social psychology studies what plays key roles in a child's developmentDuring this time, teens are faced with many issues and decisions that can impact their social development",3
"They are faced with self-esteem issues, peer pressure, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, sex, and social media.Psychologists today are not fully aware of the effect of social mediaSocial media is worldwide, so one can be influenced by something they will never encounter in real lifeIn 2019, social media became the single most important activity in adolescents' and even some older adults' lives    Replication crisis    Many social psychological research findings have proven difficult to replicate, leading some to argue that social psychology is undergoing a replication crisis",3
"Replication failures are not unique to social psychology and are found in all fields of scienceSome factors have been identified in social psychological research that has led the field to undergo its current crisisFirstly, questionable research practices have been identified as commonSuch practices, while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent, involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses, sample sizes, or data management systems, typically to convert non-significant findings into significant ones",3
"Some studies have suggested that at least mild versions of these practices are prevalentOne of the criticisms of Daryl Bem in the feeling the future controversy is that the evidence for precognition in the study could be attributed to questionable practicesSecondly, some social psychologists have published fraudulent research that has entered into mainstream academia, most notably the admitted data fabrication by Diederik Stapel as well as allegations against othersFraudulent research is not the main contributor to the replication crisis.Several effects in social psychology have been found to be difficult to replicate even before the current replication crisis",3
"For example, the scientific journal Judgment and Decision Making has published several studies over the years that fail to provide support for the unconscious thought theoryReplications appear particularly difficult when research trials are pre-registered and conducted by research groups not highly invested in the theory under questioningThese three elements together have resulted in renewed attention to replication supported by Daniel KahnemanScrutiny of many effects have shown that several core beliefs are hard to replicate",3
"A 2014 special edition of Social Psychology focused on replication studies, and a number of previously held beliefs were found to be difficult to replicateLikewise, a 2012 special edition of Perspectives on Psychological Science focused on issues ranging from publication bias to null-aversion that contribute to the replication crisis in psychology.It is important to note that this replication crisis does not mean that social psychology is unscientificRather, this reexamination is a healthy if sometimes acrimonious part of the scientific process in which old ideas or those that cannot withstand careful scrutiny are pruned",3
"Transpersonal psychology, or spiritual psychology, is a sub-field or school of psychology that integrates the spiritual and transcendent aspects of the human experience with the framework of modern psychologyThe transpersonal is defined as ""experiences in which the sense of  identity or self extends beyond (trans) the individual or personal to encompass wider aspects of humankind, life, psyche or cosmos""It has also been defined as ""development beyond conventional, personal or individual levels"".Issues considered in transpersonal psychology include spiritual self-development, self beyond the ego, peak experiences, mystical experiences, systemic trance, spiritual crises, spiritual evolution, religious conversion, altered states of consciousness, spiritual practices, and other sublime and/or unusually expanded experiences of living",3
The discipline attempts to describe and integrate spiritual experience within modern psychological theory and to formulate new theory to encompass such experienceThe Transpersonal Psychology Day is celebrated on February 27th     Definition   Lajoie and Shapiro reviewed forty definitions of transpersonal psychology that had appeared in academic literature over the period from 1968 to 1991They found that five key themes in particular featured prominently in these definitions: states of consciousness; higher or ultimate potential; beyond the ego or personal self; transcendence; and the spiritual,3
"Based upon this study the authors proposed the following definition of transpersonal psychology: Transpersonal Psychology is concerned with the study of humanity's highest potential, and with the recognition, understanding, and realization of unitive, spiritual, and transcendent states of consciousnessIn a review of previous definitions Walsh and Vaughan suggested that transpersonal psychology is an area of psychology that focuses on the study of transpersonal experiences and related phenomenaThese phenomena include the causes, effects and correlates of transpersonal experiences and development, as well as the disciplines and practices inspired by them",3
"They have also criticised many definitions of transpersonal psychology for carrying implicit assumptions, or presuppositions, that may not necessarily define the field as a whole.Note aHartelius, Caplan and Rardin conducted a retrospective analysis of definitions of transpersonal psychologyThey found three dominant themes that define the field: beyond-ego psychology, integrative/holistic psychology, and psychology of transformationAnalysis suggested that the field has moved from an early emphasis on alternative states of consciousness to a more expanded view of human wholeness and transformation",3
"This has moved the field into consideration of the impacts of states of consciousness and exceptional experiences on the psychology of the whole personCaplan (2009: p231) conveys the genesis of the discipline, states its mandate and ventures a definition:  Although transpersonal psychology is relatively new as a formal discipline, beginning with the publication of The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology in 1969 and the founding of the Association for Transpersonal Psychology in 1971, it draws upon ancient mystical knowledge that comes from multiple traditions",3
"Transpersonal psychologists attempt to integrate timeless wisdom with modern Western psychology and translate spiritual principles into scientifically grounded, contemporary languageTranspersonal psychology addresses the full spectrum of human psychospiritual development – from our deepest wounds and needs, to the existential crisis of the human being, to the most transcendent capacities of our consciousnessThe perspectives of holism and unity are central to the worldview of transpersonal psychology    Development of the field       Origins   The thinkers who have set the stage for transpersonal studies are William James, Carl Jung, Roberto Assagioli and Abraham Maslow",3
"More recent attention has brought to light transpersonal aspects of Jean Piaget's untranslated French works, and argued that Piaget's transpersonal experiences and theoretical interests were a major motivation for Piaget's psychological researchA review by Vich suggests that the earliest usage of the term ""transpersonal"" can be found in lecture notes which William James had prepared for a semester at Harvard University in 1905-6The meaning then, different from today's usage, was in the context of James' radical empiricism, in which there exists an intimate relation between a perceiving subject and a perceived object, recognizing that all objects are dependent on being perceived by someone",3
"Commentators also mention the psychedelic movement, the psychological study of religion, parapsychology, and the interest in Eastern spiritual systems and practices, as influences that shaped the early field of transpersonal psychologyAnother important figure in the establishment of transpersonal psychology was Abraham Maslow, who had already published work regarding human peak experiencesMaslow is credited for having presented the outline of a fourth-force psychology, named transhumanistic psychology, in a lecture entitled ""The Farther Reaches of Human Nature"" in 1967",3
"In 1968 Maslow was among the people who announced transpersonal psychology as a ""fourth force"" in psychology, in order to distinguish it from the three other forces of psychology: psychoanalysis, behaviorism and humanistic psychologyEarly use of the term ""transpersonal"" can also be credited to Stanislav Grof and Anthony SutichAt this time, in 1967–68, Maslow was also in close dialogue with Grof and Sutich regarding the name and orientation of the new field",3
"According to Powers the term ""transpersonal"" starts to show up in academic journals from 1970 and onwardsBoth Humanistic and Transpersonal psychology have been associated with the Human Potential Movement, a growth center for alternative therapies and philosophies that grew out of the counter-culture of the 1960s at places like Esalen, California    Formative period   Gradually, during the 1960s, the term ""transpersonal"" was associated with a distinct school of psychology within the humanistic psychology movement",3
"In 1969, Abraham Maslow, Stanislav Grof and Anthony Sutich were among the initiators behind the publication of the first issue of the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, the leading academic journal in the fieldDuring the next decade significant establishments took place under the banner of transpersonal psychologyThe Association for Transpersonal Psychology was established in 1972An international initiative, The International Transpersonal Psychology Association, was founded by Stanislav Grof, and held its first conference in Iceland in 1973",3
"This was soon to be followed by the founding of the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, a graduate training center, in 1975 The institute was founded by Robert Frager and James Fadiman in response to the academic climate of the 1970s, and included transpersonal and spiritual approaches to psychologySoon other institutions, with transpersonal psychology programs, followedAmong these were Saybrook Graduate School, the California Institute of Asian Studies (now California Institute of Integral Studies), JFK University, and Naropa.In the 1970s the field developed through the writings of such authors as Robert Frager, Alyce and Elmer Green, Daniel Goleman, Stanley Krippner, Charles Tart, Roger Walsh, John Welwood, and Ken Wilber",3
"Wilber emerged as a leading figure and major theoretician of the fieldAnother important contributor to the field, Michael Washburn, was drawing on the insights of Jungian depth psychologyAccording to Smith, Wilber and Washburn  presented the major guiding theories of transpersonal developmentThe 1980s were also characterized by the work of Stanislav and Christina Grof, and their concept of spiritual emergence and spiritual emergencies.The period also reflected initiatives at the organizational level",3
"In the early 1980s a group within APA division 32 (Humanistic Psychology) argued in favor of establishing transpersonal psychology as a separate division within the framework of the American Psychological AssociationA petition was presented to the APA Council in 1984, but was turned downA new initiative was made in 1985, but it failed to win the majority of votes in the councilIn 1986 the petition  was presented for a third and final time, but was withdrawn by the executive board of Division 32",3
"The interest group later re-formed as the Transpersonal Psychology Interest Group (TPIG), and continued to promote transpersonal issues in collaboration with Division 32.The 1990s introduced new profiles who contributed insights to the fieldAmong these authors we find Brant Cortright, Stuart Sovatsky, David Lukoff, Robert PTurner and Francis LuCortright and Sovatsky made contributions to transpersonal psychotherapyBoth authors published their primary work as part of the SUNY-series.Note b  Lukoff, Turner and Lu, writers in the clinical field, were the authors behind the proposal for a new diagnostic category to be included in the DSM-manual of the American Psychiatric Association",3
"The category was called ""Psychoreligious or psychospiritual problem"" and was approved by the Task Force on DSM-IV in 1993, after changing its name to Religious or spiritual problem.While Wilber has been considered an influential writer and theoretician in the field of transpersonal psychology, his departure from the field was becoming more obvious during the decade of the 1990sAlthough the date of his departure is unclear, Freeman notes that Wilber had been distancing himself from the label of “transpersonal”, in favour of the label of “integral”, since the mid-1990s",3
"In 1998 he formed Integral Institute.On the organizational side the decade was marked by a steady increase in membership for the Association for Transpersonal Psychology, stabilizing at approximately 3000 members in the early ninetiesIn 1996 the British Psychological Society (the UK professional body equivalent to the APA) established a Transpersonal Psychology SectionIt was co-founded by David Fontana, Ingrid Slack and Martin Treacy and was, according to Fontana, ""the first Section of its kind in a Western scientific society""",3
"In the second half of the decade commentators remarked that the field of transpersonal psychology had grown steadily and rapidly    Later developments   The beginning of the 2000s was marked by the revisionary project of Jorge Ferrer, which is considered to be an important contribution to the fieldHis main publication from this era, Revisioning Transpersonal Theory - A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality (2001), was part of the SUNY Series in Transpersonal and Humanistic Psychology",3
"In 2007, the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology and the International Journal of Transpersonal Studies were accepted for indexing in PsychINFO, the journal database of the American Psychological AssociationIn 2012 the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology announced that it was changing its name to Sofia University, a change that included a new profile in the academic landscape, with an expanded graduate program featuring computer science and businessIn 2016, the California Institute of Integral Studies launched an online PhD degree in Integral and Transpersonal Psychology, founded and chaired by Glenn Hartelius, including Jorge Ferrer on its faculty, and sponsoring publication of the International Journal of Transpersonal Studies",3
"    Branches and related fields   Several psychological schools, or branches, have influenced the field of transpersonal psychologyAmong these schools we find the Analytical psychology of Carl Jung, the psychosynthesis of Roberto Assagioli, and the humanistic psychology of Abraham MaslowThe major transpersonal models of psychotherapy, as reviewed by Cortright, are the models of Ken Wilber, C.G Jung, Michael Washburn, Stanislav Grof, and Hameed AliDrWilliam JBarry established transpersonal psychology as a valid action research method in the field of education through his Ph.D",3
"thesis and development of Transformational Quality (TQ) Theory Applications to the areas of business studies and management have been developedOther transpersonal disciplines, such as transpersonal anthropology and transpersonal business studies, are listed in transpersonal disciplinesTranspersonal art is one of the disciplines considered by Boucovolas, in listing how transpersonal psychology may relate to other areas of transpersonal studyIn writing about transpersonal art, Boucovolas begins by noting how, according to Breccia and also to the definitions employed by the International Transpersonal Association in 1971, transpersonal art may be understood as art work which draws upon important themes beyond the individual self, such as the transpersonal consciousness",3
"This makes transpersonal art criticism germane to mystical approaches to creativityTranspersonal art criticism, as Boucovolas notes, can be considered that which claims conventional art criticism has been too committed to stressing rational dimensions of art and has subsequently said little on art's spiritual dimensions, or as that which holds art work has a meaning beyond the individual personCertain aspects of the psychology of Carl Jung, as well as movements such as music therapy and art therapy, may also relate to the field",3
"Boucovolas' paper cites Breccia (1971) as an early example of transpersonal art, and claims that at the time his article appeared, integral theorist Ken Wilber had made recent contributions to the fieldMore recently, the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, in 2005, Volume 37, launched a special edition devoted to the media, which contained articles on film criticism that can be related to this fieldOther fields of study, that are related to transpersonal psychology, include near-death studies, parapsychology and humanistic psychology",3
"The major findings of near-death studies are represented in the Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology, and in The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal PsychologyThe near-death experience is also discussed in relation to other transpersonal and spiritual categoriesThe major findings of parapsychology are also represented in the Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology, and in The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology.There is also a strong connection between the transpersonal and the humanistic approaches to psychology, as indicated by the sourcebook of Donald Moss",3
"Although transpersonal psychology is considered to have started off within, or developed from humanistic psychology, many of its interests, such as spirituality and modes of consciousness, extend beyond the areas of interest discussed by humanistic theoryAccording to writers in the field transpersonal psychology advocates for an expanded, spiritual, view of physical and mental health that is not necessarily addressed by humanistic psychologyA few commentators have suggested that there is a difference between transpersonal psychology and a broader category of transpersonal theories, sometimes called transpersonal studies",3
"According to Friedman this category might  include several approaches to the transpersonal that lie outside the frames of scienceHowever, according to Ferrer the field of transpersonal psychology is ""situated within the wider umbrella of transpersonal studies""Transpersonal psychology may also, sometimes, be associated with New Age beliefs and pop psychologyHowever, leading authors in the field, among those Sovatsky, Rowan, and Hartelius have criticized the nature of ""New Age""-philosophy and discourse",3
"Rowan even states that ""The Transpersonal is not the New Age"".Although some consider that the distinction between transpersonal psychology and the psychology of religion, is fading (e.gThe Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality), there is still generally considered to be a clear distinction between the twoMuch of the focus of psychology of religion is concerned with issues that wouldn't be considered 'transcendent' within transpersonal psychology, so the two disciplines do have quite a distinct focus",3
"    Research, theory and clinical aspects       Research interests and methodology   The transpersonal perspective spans many research interestsThe following list is adapted from the Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology and includes: the contributions of spiritual traditions such as Taoism, Hinduism (Yoga), Buddhism, Kabbalah, Christian mysticism, Shamanism, and Native American healing to psychiatry and psychology; meditation research and clinical aspects of meditation; psychedelics; parapsychology; anthropology; diagnosis of religious and spiritual problem; offensive spirituality and spiritual defenses; phenomenology and treatment of Kundalini; psychotherapy; near-death experience; religious cults; psychopharmacology; guided imagery; breathwork; past life therapy; ecological survival and social change; aging and adult spiritual development",3
"The research of transpersonal psychology is based upon both quantitative and qualitative methods, but some commentators have suggested that the main contribution of transpersonal psychology has been to provide alternatives to the quantitative methods of mainstream psychology Although the field has not been a significant contributor of empirical knowledge on clinical issues, it has contributed important quantitative research to areas such as the study of  meditation    Theories on human development   One of the demarcations in transpersonal theory is between authors who are associated with hierarchical/holarchical, sequential, or stage-like models of human development, such as Ken Wilber and John Battista, and authors who are associated with Jungian perspectives, or models that include the principle of regression, such as Michael Washburn and Stanislav Grof",3
"     Ken Wilber and John Battista    The transpersonal psychology of Ken Wilber is often mentioned as an influential theoretical framework for the fieldWilber is often regarded as a leading theorist and pioneer of the transpersonal movement, but he has not been actively associated with the label for quite some timeSeveral commentators note that he has distanced himself from the transpersonal field in favour of a new model that he calls integral",3
"However, his psychological model still remains  influential to the practice and development of transpersonal psychology, and transpersonal themes remain a central part of his own workCentral to his theory of consciousness is a synthesis of eastern and western psychologies and models of human development.Wilber's model of consciousness consists of three broad developmental categories: the prepersonal or pre-egoic, the personal or egoic, and the transpersonal or trans-egoicA more detailed version of this model includes nine different levels of human development, in which levels 1-3 are pre-personal levels, levels 4-6 are personal levels and levels 7-9 are transpersonal levels",3
"Later versions also include a tenth levelThe transpersonal stages, or the upper levels of the model, are the home of spiritual events and developmentsThe framework proposed by Wilber suggests that human development is a progressive movement through these stages of consciousnessThe theory implies that different schools of psychology are associated with different levels of the model, and that each level of organization, or self-development, includes a vulnerability to certain pathologies associated with that particular level",3
"Each level also represents developmental tasks that must be properly met, or they might lead to developmental arrestA basic tenet of Wilber's transpersonal psychology is a concept called the ""pre/trans fallacy""That is, a confusion of transpersonal progression with prepersonal regressionAccording to writers in the field western schools of psychology have  had a tendency to regard transpersonal levels as pathological, equating them with regressive pathological conditions belonging to a lower level on the model",3
"The pre/trans fallacy describes a lack of differentiation between these two categoriesWilber's understanding of  the levels of consciousness, or reality, ranging from matter to body to mind to soul to spirit, or from prepersonal to personal to transpersonal, is often referred to as the ""Great Chain of Being""This overarching framework, that is adapted from the ""perennial philosophy"" of the worlds great spiritual traditions, is later reformulated by Wilber as the ""Great Nest of Being""",3
"That is, not just a simple linear hierarchy, but a kind of nested hierarchy, or holarchyHuman development, and evolution, is considered to move up this holarchy.The 1990s marked a move into the world of integral ideas for WilberAccording to commentators he stopped referring to his work as transpersonal, in favor of the term integral, by the mid-1990sLiterature now confirms that he has shifted from transpersonal psychology to integral psychology",3
"According to Brys & Bokor Wilber presented major parts of his integral approach in the years 1997-2000The integral theory included a four quadrant model of consciousness and its development, whose dimensions were said to unfold in a sequence of stages or levelsThe combination of quadrants and levels resulting in an all-quadrant, all-level approachThe theory also included the concept of holon, ""a whole that is simultaneously part of some other whole"", and holarchy, ""hierarchical holons within holons""",3
"According to reviewers, the spiritual dimension was central to Wilber's integral visionSimilar to the model presented by Wilber is the information theory of consciousness presented by John BattistaBattista suggests that the development of the self-system, and of human psychology, consists of a series of transitions in the direction of enhanced maturity and psychological stability, and in the direction of transpersonal and spiritual categoriesHis model presents a series of developmental tasks with corresponding levels of consciousness and psychopathology, and discusses therapeutic interventions in relation to the different levels and transitions",3
"     Michael Washburn and  Stanislav Grof    Michael Washburn presents a model of human development that is informed by psychoanalysis, object-relations theory, and the depth psychology of the Jungian perspectiveIn the context of transpersonal psychotherapy Washburn's approach has been described as a «revision of Jung's analytical psychology».According to Washburn transpersonal development follows the principles of a spiraling pathCentral to his model is the understanding of a dynamic ground; a deep level of the unconscious, with spiritual qualities, that the person is in contact with in the prepersonal stage of development",3
"According to commentators Washburn describes three stages of human development; the pre-personal, the personal and the transpersonal, also described as; pre-egoic, egoic and trans-egoicIn the pre-stage (up to age 5) the child is integrated with the dynamic groundLater in life this contact is weakened, and the prepersonal stage is followed by a new stage of development where the ego is dissociated from the dynamic groundThis happens through the process of repression, and marks the stage of adulthood, and of the mental ego (egoic stage).However, later in life there is the possibility of a re-integration with the dynamic ground, a trans-egoic stage",3
"According to Washburn this transpersonal development requires a kind of U-turn, or going back to the dynamic ground, in order for the ego to become integrated with its unconscious dynamicsThis aspect of Wasburn's model is described by commentators as «a going back before a higher going forth»A regression that paves the way for transcendence, and a fully embodied lifeWashburn's approach to transpersonal development is often summed up as «regression in the service of transcendence» which, according to Lev, is a ""twist of the phrase, regression in the service of the ego""",3
"Washburn has contrasted his own perspective, which he calls spiral-dynamic, to the developmental theory of Ken Wilber, which he calls structural-hierarchicalThe differing views of  Washburn and Wilber are mentioned by several commentators.Stanislav Grof, on the other hand, operates with a cartography consisting of three kinds of territories: the realm of the sensory barrier and the personal unconscious (described by psychoanalysis), the perinatal or birth-related realm (organizing principles for the psyche), and the transpersonal realm",3
"According to this view proper engagement with the first two realms sets the stage for an ascent to the third, transpersonal, realmHis early therapy, and research, was carried out with the aid of psychedelic substancesAccording to commentators Grof's LSD-therapy was controversialLater, when LSD was prohibited, Grof developed other methods of therapy, such as holotropic breathworkThe controversy surrounding Holotropic Breathwork at the Findhorn Foundation is described later in this article",3
"His early findings, which were based on observations from LSD research, uncovered four major types of experiences that, according to Grof, correspond to levels in the human unconscious: (1) Abstract and aesthetic experiences; (2) Psychodynamic experiences; (3) Perinatal experiences; (4) Transpersonal experiencesGrof returns to many of these findings in later booksPsychodynamic levels, which correspond to the theory of Sigmund Freud, is the area of biographical memories, emotional problems, unresolved conflicts and fantasies",3
"Perinatal levels, which correspond to the theories of Otto Rank, is the area of physical pain and agony, dying and death, biological birth, aging, disease and decrepitudeTranspersonal levels, corresponding to the theories of C.GJung, is the area of a number of spiritual, paranormal and transcendental experiences, including ESP phenomena, ego transcendence and other states of expanded consciousnessIn order to bring structure to the psychodynamic and perinatal levels Grof introduces two governing systems, or organizing principles: The COEX-system, which is the governing system for the psychodynamic level, and the Basic Perinatal Matrices, which represent the birthing stages and is the governing system for the perinatal level.Grof applies regressional modes of therapy (originally with the use of psychedelic substances, later with other methods) in order to seek greater psychological integration",3
"This has led to the confrontation of constructive and deconstructive models of the process leading to genuine mental health: what Wilber sees as a pre/trans fallacy does not exist for Washburn and Grof, for pre-rational states may be genuinely transpersonal, and re-living them may be essential in the process of achieving genuine sanity     Stuart Sovatsky    The idea of development is also featured in the spiritual psychotherapy and psychology of Stuart SovatskyHis understanding of human development, which is largely informed by east/west psychology and the tradition and hermeneutics of Yoga, places the human being in the midst of spiritual energies and processes outlined in yogic philosophy",3
"According to Sovatsky these are maturational processes, affecting body and soulSovatsky adapts the concept of Kundalini as the maturational force of human developmentAccording to his model a number of advanced yogic processes are said to assist in ""maturation of the ensouled body""    Transpersonal theory of Jorge Ferrer   The scholarship of Jorge Ferrer introduces a more pluralistic and participatory perspective on spiritual and ontological dimensionsIn his revision of transpersonal theory Ferrer questions three major presuppositions, or frameworks for interpretation, that have been dominant in transpersonal studies",3
"These are the frameworks of Experientalism (the transpersonal understood as an individual inner experience); Inner empiricism (the study of transpersonal phenomena according to the standards of empiricist science); and perennialism (the legacy of the perennial philosophy in transpersonal studies)Although representing important frames of reference for the initial study of transpersonal phenomena, Ferrer believes that these assumptions have become limiting and problematic for the development of the field.As an alternative to these major epistemological and philosophical trends Ferrer focuses upon the great variety, or pluralism, of spiritual insights and spiritual worlds that can be disclosed by transpersonal inquiry",3
"In contrast to the transpersonal models that are informed by the ""perennial philosophy"" he introduces the idea of a “dynamic and indeterminate spiritual power.” Along these lines he also introduces the metaphor of the ""ocean of emancipation""According to Ferrer ""the ocean of emancipation has many shores""That is, different spiritual truths can be reached by arriving at different spiritual shores.The second aspect of his revision, ""the participatory turn"", introduces the idea that transpersonal phenomena are participatory and co-creative events",3
"He defines these events as ""emergences of transpersonal being that can occur not only in the locus of an individual, but also in a relationship, a community, a collective identity or a place."" This participatory knowing is multidimensional, and includes all the powers of the human being (body/heart/soul), as understood from a transpersonal frameworkAccording to Jaenke Ferrer's vision includes a spiritual reality that is plural and multiple, and a spiritual power that may produce a wide range of revelations and insights, which in turn may be overlapping, or even incompatible",3
"Ferrer's approach to participatory thinking has been taken-up in the context of psychoanalysis Drawing from Ferrer's criticisms of perennialism, Robin SBrown adopts the participatory paradigm as a means to fostering clinical pluralism    Transpersonal psychotherapy   Early contributions to the field of transpersonal psychotherapy includes the approach of Walsh & VaughanIn their outline of transpersonal therapy they emphasize that the goals of  therapy includes both traditional outcomes, such as symptom relief and behaviour change, as well as work at the transpersonal level, which may transcend psychodynamic issues",3
"Both Karma Yoga and altered states of consciousness are part of the transpersonal approach to therapyAccording to Walsh & Vaughan the context of karma yoga, and service, should also facilitate a process whereby the psychological growth of the therapist could provide supporting environment for the growth of the client.Several authors in the field have presented an integration of western psychotherapy with spiritual psychology, among these Stuart Sovatsky and Brant CortrightIn his reformulation of western psychotherapy Sovatsky addresses the questions of time, temporality and soteriology from the perspectives of east/west psychology and spirituality",3
"Besides drawing on the insights of post-freudians, such as D.WWinnicott, Sovatsky integrates his approach to psychotherapy with an expanded understanding of body and mind, informed by the philosophy of Yoga.Cortright, on the other hand, has reviewed the field of transpersonal psychotherapy and the major transpersonal models of psychotherapy, including Wilber, Jung, Washburn, Grof and Ali, as well as  existential, psychoanalytic, and body-centered approachesHe also presents a unifying theoretical framework for the field of transpersonal psychotherapy, and identifies the dimension of human consciousness as central to the transpersonal realm",3
"He also addresses clinical issues related to meditation, spiritual emergency, and altered states of consciousnessAccording to commentators Cortright challenges the traditional view of transpersonal psychology that a working through of psychological issues is necessary for progression on the spiritual pathInstead he suggests that these two lines of development are intertwined, and that they come to the foreground with shifting emphasisA transpersonal approach to clinical practice has been outlined by psychoanalyst Robin S",3
"Brown who draws from relational psychoanalysis, analytical psychology, and participatory theoryWithin contemporary psychoanalysis it has been suggested that, from a clinical point of view, postulating a transcendent dimension to human experience is theoretically necessary in promoting non-reductive approaches to therapy.The first book to survey the field of spiritually oriented psychotherapy, published by the American Psychological Association in 2005, included a chapter on the Transpersonal–Integrative Approach to therapy    Clinical and diagnostic issues   Transpersonal psychology has also brought clinical attention to the topic of spiritual crisisNote d, a category that is not ordinarily recognized by  mainstream psychology",3
"Among the clinical problems associated with this category, according to transpersonal theory, are: psychiatric complications related to mystical experience; near-death experience; Kundalini awakening; shamanic crisis (also called shamanic illness); psychic opening; intensive meditation; separation from a spiritual teacher; medical or terminal illness; addictionThe terms ""spiritual emergence"" and ""spiritual emergency"" were coined by Stanislav and Christina Grof in order to describe the appearance of spiritual phenomena, and spiritual processes, in a persons life.Note e The term ""spiritual emergence"" describes a gradual unfoldment of spiritual potential with little disruption in psychological, social and occupational functioning",3
"In cases where the emergence of spiritual phenomena is intensified beyond the control of the individual it may lead to a state of ""spiritual emergency""A spiritual emergency may cause significant disruption in psychological, social and occupational functioningMany of the psychological difficulties described above can, according to Transpersonal theory, lead to episodes of spiritual emergency.Note fAt the beginning of the 1990s a group of psychologists and psychiatrists, affiliated with the field of transpersonal psychology, saw the need for a new psychiatric category involving religious and spiritual problems",3
"Their concern was the possibility of misdiagnosis of these problemsBased on an extensive literature review, and networking with the American Psychiatric Association Committee on Religion and Psychiatry, the group made a proposal for a new diagnostic category entitled ""Psychoreligious or Psychospiritual Problem""The proposal was submitted to the Task Force on DSM-IV in 1991The category was approved by the Task Force in 1993, after changing the title to ""Religious or Spiritual Problem""",3
"It is included in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), as a minor category Note g The text of the new category did not mention the particular spiritual problems, or psychiatric complications, listed aboveAccording to the authors of the proposal the new category ""addressed problems of a religious or spiritual nature that are the focus of clinical attention and not attributable to a mental disorder""",3
"In their view there exist criteria for differentiating between spiritual problems and mental disorders such as psychosisThis concern is also addressed in the DSM-IV SourcebookAccording to Lukoff and Lu, co-authors of the category, religious or spiritual problems are not classified as mental disordersFoulks also notes that the new diagnosis is included in the DSM-IV-TR nonillness category (Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention)Addition of the new category to the DSM-system was noticed by a few psychiatric publications, and the New York Times",3
"Several commentators have also offered their viewpointsChinen notes that the inclusion marks ""increasing professional acceptance of transpersonal issues"", while Sovatsky sees the addition as an admittance of spiritually oriented narratives into mainstream clinical practiceSmart and Smart recognizes the addition of the category, and similar improvements in the fourth version, as a step forward for the cultural sensitivity of the DSM manualGreyson, representing the field of Near-death studies, concludes that the diagnostic category of Religious or spiritual problem ""permits differentiation of near-death experiences and similar experiences from mental disorders""",3
"In a study from 2000 Milstein and colleagues discussed the construct validity of the new DSM-IV category religious or spiritual problem (V62.89).According to commentators transpersonal psychology recognizes that transcendent psychological states, and spirituality, might have both negative and positive effects on human functioningHealth-promoting expressions of spirituality include development and growth, but there also exist health-compromising expressions of spirituality    Organizations, publications and locations   A leading institution within the field of transpersonal psychology is the Association for Transpersonal Psychology, which was founded in 1972",3
"Past presidents of the association include Alyce Green, James Fadiman, Frances Vaughan, Arthur Hastings, Daniel Goleman, Robert Frager, Ronald Jue, Jeanne Achterberg and Dwight JudyAn international organization, The International Transpersonal Psychology Association, was founded in the 1970s, and has more recently been revived by Harris FriedmanAlso, a European counterpart to the American institution, the European Transpersonal Psychology Association (ETPA), was founded much laterThe leading graduate school is Sofia University, formerly the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology",3
"According to sources the university is private, non-sectarian, and accredited by the Western Association of Schools and CollegesLeading academic publications within the field include the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology and the International Journal of Transpersonal StudiesSmaller publications include the Transpersonal Psychology Review, the journal of the Transpersonal Psychology Section of the British Psychological SocietyIn 1996 Basic Books published the Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology, a standard text that included a thorough overview of the field",3
"In 1999 Greenwood Press published a title called Humanistic and transpersonal psychology: A historical and biographical sourcebook, which includes biographical and critical essays on central figures in humanistic  and transpersonal psychologyA recent publication, The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology, is one of the latest and most updated introductions to the field of transpersonal psychology.Although the perspectives of transpersonal psychology has spread to a number of interest groups across the US and Europe, its origins were in California, and the field has always been strongly associated with institutions on the west coast of the US",3
"Both the Association for Transpersonal Psychology and the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology were founded in the state of California, and a number of the fields leading theorists come from this area of the US    Reception, recognition and criticism       Reception   Reception of Transpersonal psychology, in the surrounding culture, reflects a wide range of views and opinions, including both recognition and skepticismTranspersonal psychology has been the topic of a few academic articles and book reviews in other academic fields, including Psychiatry, Behavioral Science, Psychology, Social Work, Consciousness Studies, Religious Studies, Pastoral psychology, and Library Science.Several commentators have expressed their views on the field of transpersonal psychology and its contribution to the academic landscape",3
"Hilgard, representing the contemporary psychology of the early 1980s, regarded transpersonal psychology as a fringe-movement that attracted the more extreme followers of Humanistic psychologyHe did however remark that such movements might enrich the topics that psychologists study, even though most psychologists choose not to join the movementAdams also regarded Transpersonal psychology as a fringe discipline He also observed its status as a controversial field of studyCowley and Derezotes, representing the Social Work theory of the 1990s, regarded transpersonal psychology as relevant for the development of spiritual sensitivity in the helping disciplines",3
"Bidwell, representing the field of pastoral psychology, saw transpersonal psychology as a developing field that had largely been  ignored by his own professionHe did however believe that transpersonal psychology could contribute to the areas of  pastoral theology and pastoral counselingElkins, writing for the field of spiritually oriented psychotherapy, considered that transpersonal psychology had grown away from its roots in the humanistic movement and that it had established its own theories and perspectives",3
"Taylor, representing the field of Humanistic Psychology, presented a balanced review of transpersonal psychology in the early ninetiesOn the negative side he mentioned transpersonal Psychology's tendency toward being philosophically naive, poorly financed, almost anti-intellectual, and somewhat overrated as far as its influencesOn the positive side he noted the fields integrated approach to understanding the phenomenology of scientific method; the centrality of qualitative research; and the importance of interdisciplinary communicationIn conclusion he suggested that the virtues of transpersonal psychology may, in the end, outweigh its defects",3
"In a later article Taylor regarded transpersonal psychology as a visionary American folk-psychology with little historical relation to American academic psychology, except through its association with Humanistic psychology and the categories of transcendence and consciousnessRuzek, who interviewed founders of transpersonal psychology, as well as historians of American psychology, found that the field had made little impact on the larger field of psychology in AmericaAmong the factors that contributed to this situation was mainstream psychology's resistance to spiritual and philosophical ideas, and the tendency of Transpersonal psychologists to isolate themselves from the larger context",3
"A few small attempts have been made to introduce Transpersonal psychology to the classroom settingPerspectives from transpersonal psychology are represented in  a widely used college textbook on personality theories, marking the entrance of transpersonal themes into mainstream academic settingsIn this book author Barbara Engler asks the question, ""Is spirituality an appropriate topic for psychological study?"" She offers a brief account of the history of transpersonal psychology and a peek into its possible future",3
"The classroom dimension is also present in a book on personality theories by authors Robert Frager and James FadimanIn this publication they provide an account of the contributions of many of the key historic figures who have shaped and developed transpersonal psychology (in addition to discussing and explaining important concepts and theories germane to it), which serves to promote an understanding of the discipline in classroom settingsNoting that the majority of mainstream psychology departments rarely offer training programs in transpersonal issues and practices as part of their curriculum, graduate programs in humanistic and transpersonal psychology have been made available at a few North-American Universities.Note c Among these we find John F",3
"Kennedy University in Orinda, which included transpersonal psychology in its holistic studies program, and Burlington College in VermontIn 2012 Columbia University announced that they  were integrating spiritual psychology, similar to the perspectives taught at Sofia University (California), into their clinical psychology program.However, although transpersonal psychology has experienced some minor recognition from the surrounding culture, it has also faced a fair amount of skepticism and criticism from the same surroundingsFreeman mentions that the early field of transpersonal psychology was aware of the possibility that it would be rejected by the scientific community",3
"The method of inner empiricism, based on disciplined introspection, was to be a target of skepticism from outsiders in the years to comeSeveral commentators have mentioned the controversial aspects of transpersonal psychologyZdenek, representing a moderate criticism from the 1980s, noted that the field was regarded as controversial since its inceptionOther commentators, such as Friedman, and Adams, also mention the controversial status of the fieldIn 1998 the San Francisco Chronicle reported on the holistic studies program at the John F",3
"Kennedy University in Orinda, which included a transpersonal psychology departmentThe program was considered to be unique at the time, but also controversialCommentators presented their skepticism towards the program.Another contentious aspect concerns the topic of psychedelic substancesCommenting upon the controversial status of psychedelic and entheogenic substances in contemporary culture, authors Elmer, MacDonald & Friedman observe that these drugs have been used for therapeutic effect in the transpersonal movement, but - the authors add - this is not the most common form of transpersonal intervention in contemporary therapy",3
"However, Bravo and Grob note that ""the place of psychedelics in spiritual practice remains controversial"" Commenting on the state of the field in the mid-nineties Chinen noted that professional publications, until then, had been hesitant to publish articles that dealt with transpersonal subjectsAdams noted that the field has struggled for recognition as a legitimate field of study in the academic community, while Parsons  noted that Transpersonal psychology's naive perennialism, misreading of religious texts, lack of methodological sophistication, and weak epistemology had not been well received by most in academia",3
"    Criticism, skepticism and response   Criticism and skepticism towards the field of transpersonal psychology has been presented by a wide assortment of commentators, and includes both writers from within its own ranks, as well as writers representing other fields of psychology or philosophyCritical remarks from within the field include the observations of Lukoff and Lu, and the criticism of WalachIn their contribution to the field of spiritually oriented psychotherapy Lukoff and Lu discuss the strengths and weaknesses of transpersonal psychotherapy and transpersonal psychology",3
"Among the strengths is its basis of theory and practice that allows for communication and dialogue with other cultures, and native healersAmong the weaknesses is a lack of theoretical agreement, which has led to internal debates, and attention from critics who question the validity of the transpersonal approachAnother source, close to the field, is The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal PsychologyIn a chapter from this book Walach brings attention to unsolved problems within the field",3
"According to the editors the criticism represents ""the sort of self-criticism that is mandatory within a responsible discipline""Criticism from other profiles, close to the field, also include the observations of Ken Wilber and Jorge FerrerWilber, one of the early profiles within the transpersonal field, has repeatedly announced the demise of transpersonal psychologyHowever, the early transpersonal theory of Wilber was itself subject to criticism, most notably from humanistic psychologists Rollo May and Kirk Schneider",3
"Even though Wilber has distanced himself from transpersonal psychology in favour of integral philosophy, his transpersonal model has continued to attract both recognition and criticism.Among the critics of Wilber we also find Ferrer, who in 2001 published a revision of transpersonal theoryIn this revision he criticized transpersonal psychology for being too loyal to the perennial philosophy, for introducing a subtle Cartesianism, and for being too preoccupied with intrasubjective spiritual states (inner empiricism)",3
"As an alternative to these trends he suggests a participatory vision of human spirituality that honors a wide assortment of spiritual insights, spiritual worlds and places     Criticism from humanistic and existential psychology    One of the earliest criticisms of the field was issued by the humanistic psychologist Rollo May, who disputed the conceptual foundations of transpersonal psychologyAccording to commentators May also criticized the field for neglecting the personal dimension of the psyche by elevating the pursuit of the transcendental, and for neglecting the ""dark side of human nature""",3
"Commentators note that these reservations, expressed by May, might reflect what later theorists have referred to as ""spiritual bypassing""Other commentators have suggested that May only focused on ""New Age popularizations of transpersonal approaches"" However, criticism has also come from other profiles in the fields of humanistic psychology and existential psychologyEugene Taylor and Kirk Schneider have raised objections to several aspects of transpersonal psychologySchneider, representing the field of existential psychology, got involved at the end of the 1980's",3
"The main points of  his critique of Transpersonal psychology and Wilber's transpersonal model, was that he doubted that anyone could attain true transpersonal awareness, or “divine consciousness—a totally unrestricted, transcendent oneness with all time and space”He also doubted that anyone who experienced transpersonal awareness would be able verify the attainment of this state of consciousness in themselves or othersHe argued that this transpersonal development would be irrelevant and unnecessaryFinally, he added that a society of transpersonally enlightened individuals would be boring",3
"Wilber responded to Schneider's critique by questioning if Schneider had understood his definition of ultimate transpersonal consciousness, and suggested that Schneider had a “outside looking in” view of transpersonal experienceIn a later commentary Schneider took issue with Wilbers description of transpersonal levels of consciousness and found it to have “some disturbing presumptions» that «go to the heart of what it means to be a human being»     Relationship to science and scientific criteria    According to Lukoff and Lu the American Psychological Association expressed some concerns about the ""unscientific"" nature of transpersonal psychology at the time of the petition to the APA (see above)",3
"Rowan notes that the Association had serious reservations about opening up a Transpersonal Psychology DivisionThe petitions for divisional status failed to win the majority of votes in the APA council, and the division was never establishedCommentators also mention that transpersonal psychology's association with the ideas of religion was one of the concerns that prohibited it from becoming a separate division of the APA at the time of the petition in 1984.The field of transpersonal psychology has been criticized for lacking conceptual, evidentiary, and scientific rigor",3
"In a review of criticisms of the field, Cunningham writes, ""philosophers have criticized transpersonal psychology because its metaphysics is naive and epistemology is undevelopedMultiplicity of definitions and lack of operationalization of many of its concepts has led to a conceptual confusion about the nature of transpersonal psychology itself (i.e., the concept is used differently by different theorists and means different things to different people)Biologists have criticized transpersonal psychology for its lack of attention to biological foundations of behavior and experience",3
"Physicists have criticized transpersonal psychology for inappropriately accommodating physic concepts as explanations of consciousness.""Others, such as Friedman, has suggested that the field is underdeveloped as a field of science and that it has, consequently, not produced a good scientific understanding of transpersonal phenomenaIn his proposal for a new division of labour within the transpersonal field he suggests a distinction between transpersonal studies, a broad category that might include non-scientific approaches, and transpersonal psychology, a more narrow discipline that should align itself more closely with the principles of scientific psychology",3
"However, this criticism has been answered by Ferrer  who argues that Friedmans proposal attaches transpersonal psychology to a naturalistic metaphysical worldview that is unsuitable for the domain of spirituality Albert Ellis, a cognitive psychologist and humanist, has questioned the results of transpersonal psychotherapy, the scientific status of transpersonal psychology, and its relationship to religion, mysticism and authoritarian belief systemsThis criticism has been answered by Wilber who questioned Ellis' understanding of the domain of religion, and  the field of Transpersonal Psychology; and Walsh who questioned Ellis' critique of nonrational-emotive therapies",3
"Other commentators, such as Matthews, are more supportive of the field, but remarks that a weakness of transpersonal psychology, and transpersonal psychotherapy, has been its reliance on anecdotal clinical experiences rather than researchAdams, writing from the perspective of Consciousness Studies, has problematized the concept of introspective 'data' that appears to make up the ""database"" of  transpersonal psychologyWalach and Runehov have responded to this issue.Transpersonal psychology has been noted for undervaluing quantitative methods as a tool for improving our knowledge of spiritual and transpersonal categories",3
"This is, according to commentators, a consequence of a general orientation within the field that regards spiritual and transpersonal experience to be categories that defy conceptualization and quantification, and thereby not well suited for conventional scientific inquiry     Other Criticism    In his criticism of Wilber's transpersonal model Adams identified an ambiguous and inconsistent definition of ‘God’; a flawed epistemology that  privileged non-dualism; faulty and selective use of textual sources; contradictory positions regarding the presence of a personal element in the divine nature; de-valuation of the individual self; and inadequate emphasis on the moral component of spiritual development",3
"Commentators have also made observations about the work of Stanislav GrofBoth Stromand Humphrey described Grof’s early LSD-therapy as controversialOther aspects of Grof’s therapies have also come under scrutinyIn 1992 The Guardian was reporting from the activities of the Findhorn FoundationOne of the therapies offered by the foundation was Grof’s Holotropic Breathwork, which was causing concern and attracting considerable oppositionFrom the standpoint of Dzogchen, the teachings from Tibetan Buddhism, and Buddhism generally, Elías Capriles has objected that transpersonal psychology fails to distinguish between the transpersonal condition of nirvana, which is inherently liberating, and those transpersonal conditions which are within samsara",3
" In the process of elaborating what he calls a meta-transpersonal psychology, Capriles has carried out refutations of Wilber, Grof and Washburn.Although the ideas of William James are considered central to the transpersonal field, Gary Alexander suggested that transpersonal psychology did not have a clear understanding of the negative dimensions of consciousness (such as evil) expressed in James' philosophyThis criticism has been absorbed by later transpersonal theory, which has been more willing to reflect on these important dimensions of human existence.Skepticism towards the concept of spiritual emergencies, and the transpersonal dimension in psychiatry, has been expressed by Alison J",3
"Gray, who stated that ""this is not an approach I personally find internally consistent, helpful or believable""According to Cunningham, transpersonal psychology has been criticized by some Christian authors for being ""a mishmash of 'New Age' ideas that offer an alternative faith system to vulnerable youths who turn their backs on organized religion (Adeney, 1988)"".Transpersonal psychology has also been criticized for emphasizing oneness and holism at the expense of diversityAccording to John V",3

"Cynicism (Ancient Greek: κυνισμός) is a school of thought of ancient Greek philosophy as practiced by the Cynics (Ancient Greek: Κυνικοί; Latin: Cynici)For the Cynics, the purpose of life is to live in virtue, in agreement with natureAs reasoning creatures, people can gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which is natural for themselves, rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, and fame, and even flouting conventions openly and derisively in public",4
"Instead, they were to lead a simple life free from all possessionsThe first philosopher to outline these themes was Antisthenes, who had been a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BCEHe was followed by Diogenes, who lived in a ceramic jar on the streets of AthensDiogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopherHe was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens",4
"Cynicism gradually declined in importance after the 3rd century BCE, but it experienced a revival with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st centuryCynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire, and similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appeared in early ChristianityBy the 19th century, emphasis on the negative aspects of Cynic philosophy led to the modern understanding of cynicism to mean a disposition of disbelief in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions",4
"    Origin of the Cynic name   The term cynic derives from Ancient Greek  κυνικός (kynikos) 'dog-like', and  κύων (kyôn) 'dog' (genitive: kynos)One explanation offered in ancient times for why the Cynics were called ""dogs"" was because the first Cynic, Antisthenes, taught in the Cynosarges gymnasium at AthensThe word cynosarges means the ""place of the white dog""It seems certain, however, that the word dog was also thrown at the first Cynics as an insult for their shameless rejection of conventional manners, and their decision to live on the streets",4
"Diogenes, in particular, was referred to as the ""Dog"", a distinction he seems to have revelled in, stating that ""other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them."" Later Cynics also sought to turn the word to their advantage, as a later commentator explained:  There are four reasons why the Cynics are so namedFirst because of the indifference of their way of life, for they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads",4
"The second reason is that the dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to itThe third reason is that the dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophyThe fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemiesSo do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them",4
"    Philosophy   Cynicism is one of the most striking of all the Hellenistic philosophiesIt claimed to offer people the possibility of happiness and freedom from suffering in an age of uncertaintyAlthough there was never an official Cynic doctrine, the fundamental principles of Cynicism can be summarized as follows: The goal of life is eudaimonia and mental clarity or lucidity (ἁτυφια)—literally ""freedom from smoke (τύφος)"" which signified false belief, mindlessness, folly, and conceit",4
"Eudaimonia is achieved by living in accord with Nature as understood by human reasonArrogance (τύφος) is caused by false judgments of value, which cause negative emotions, unnatural desires, and a vicious characterEudaimonia, or human flourishing, depends on self-sufficiency (αὐτάρκεια), equanimity, arete, love of humanity, parrhesia, and  indifference to the vicissitudes of life (adiaphora ἁδιαφορία)One progresses towards flourishing and clarity through ascetic practices (ἄσκησις) which help one become free from influences such as wealth, fame, and power that have no value in Nature",4
"Instead they promoted living a life of ponosFor the Cynics, this did not seem to mean actual physical workDiogenes of Sinope, for example, lived by begging, not by doing manual laborRather, it means deliberately choosing a hard life—for instance, wearing only a thin cloak and going barefoot in winterA Cynic practices shamelessness or impudence (Αναιδεια) and defaces the nomos of society: the laws, customs, and social conventions that people take for granted",4
"Thus a Cynic has no property and rejects all conventional values of money, fame, power and reputationA life lived according to nature requires only the bare necessities required for existence, and one can become free by unshackling oneself from any needs which are the result of conventionThe Cynics adopted Heracles as their hero, as epitomizing the ideal CynicHeracles ""was he who brought Cerberus, the hound of Hades, from the underworld, a point of special appeal to the dog-man, Diogenes."" According to Lucian, ""Cerberus and Cynic are surely related through the dog.""The Cynic way of life required continuous training, not just in exercising judgments and mental impressions, but a physical training as well:  [Diogenes] used to say, that there were two kinds of exercise: that, namely, of the mind and that of the body; and that the latter of these created in the mind such quick and agile impressions at the time of its performance, as very much facilitated the practice of virtue; but that one was imperfect without the other, since the health and vigour necessary for the practice of what is good, depend equally on both mind and body",4
"None of this meant that a Cynic would retreat from societyCynics were in fact to live in the full glare of the public's gaze and be quite indifferent in the face of any insults which might result from their unconventional behaviourThe Cynics are said to have invented the idea of cosmopolitanism: when he was asked where he came from, Diogenes replied that he was ""a citizen of the world, (kosmopolitês).""The ideal Cynic would evangelise; as the watchdog of humanity, they thought it their duty to hound people about the error of their ways",4
"The example of the Cynic's life (and the use of the Cynic's biting satire) would dig up and expose the pretensions which lay at the root of everyday conventions.Although Cynicism concentrated primarily on ethics, some Cynics, such as Monimus, addressed epistemology with regard to tuphos (τῦφος) expressing skeptical viewsCynic philosophy had a major impact on the Hellenistic world, ultimately becoming an important influence for StoicismThe Stoic Apollodorus, writing in the 2nd century BCE, stated that ""Cynicism is the short path to virtue.""     History of Cynicism    The classical Greek and Roman Cynics regarded virtue as the only necessity for happiness, and saw virtue as entirely sufficient for attaining it",4
"Classical Cynics followed this philosophy to the extent of neglecting everything not furthering their perfection of virtue and attainment of happiness, thus, the  title of Cynic, derived from the Greek word κύων (meaning ""dog"") because they allegedly neglected society, hygiene, family, money, etc., in a manner reminiscent of dogsThey sought to free themselves from conventions; become self-sufficient; and live only in accordance with natureThey rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, power, and fame, to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, lives.The ancient Cynics rejected conventional social values, and would criticise the types of behaviours, such as greed, which they viewed as causing suffering",4
"Emphasis on this aspect of their teachings led, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, to the modern understanding of cynicism as ""an attitude of scornful or jaded negativity, especially a general distrust of the integrity or professed motives of others."" This modern definition of cynicism is in marked contrast to the ancient philosophy, which emphasized ""virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire.""     Influences   Various philosophers, such as the Pythagoreans, had advocated simple living in the centuries preceding the Cynics",4
"In the early 6th century BCE, Anacharsis, a Scythian sage, had combined plain living together with criticisms of Greek customs in a manner which would become standard among the CynicsPerhaps of importance were tales of Indian philosophers, known as gymnosophists, who had adopted a strict asceticismBy the 5th century BCE, the sophists had begun a process of questioning many aspects of Greek society such as religion, law and ethicsHowever, the most immediate influence for the Cynic school was Socrates",4
"Although he was not an ascetic, he did profess a love of virtue and an indifference to wealth, together with a disdain for general opinion These aspects of Socrates' thought, which formed only a minor part of Plato's philosophy, became the central inspiration for another of Socrates' pupils, Antisthenes    Symbolisms   Cynics were often recognized in the ancient world by their apparel—an old cloak and a staffThe cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles",4
"These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.In the social evolution from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleisOriginally it was expected that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom",4
"Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itselfAccording to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user's dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, and at the same time it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothingThus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man's need to support himself",4
"The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength—a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher    Antisthenes    The story of Cynicism traditionally begins with Antisthenes (c445–365 BCE), who was an older contemporary of Plato and a pupil of Socrates About 25 years his junior, Antisthenes was one of the most important of Socrates' disciples",4
" Although later classical authors had little doubt about labelling him as the founder of Cynicism, his philosophical views seem to be more complex than the later simplicities of pure Cynicism In the list of works ascribed to Antisthenes by Diogenes Laërtius, writings on language, dialogue and literature far outnumber those on ethics or politics, although they may reflect how his philosophical interests changed with timeIt is certainly true that Antisthenes preached a life of poverty:  I have enough to eat till my hunger is stayed, to drink till my thirst is sated; to clothe myself as well; and out of doors not [even] Callias there, with all his riches, is more safe than I from shivering; and when I find myself indoors, what warmer shirting do I need than my bare walls?     Diogenes of Sinope    Diogenes (c",4
"412–323 BCE) dominates the story of Cynicism like no other figure He originally went to Athens, fleeing his home city, after he and his father, who was in charge of the mint at Sinope, got into trouble for falsifying the coinage (The phrase ""defacing the currency"" later became proverbial in describing Diogenes' rejection of conventional values.)  Later tradition claimed that Diogenes became the disciple of Antisthenes, but it is by no means certain that they ever met",4
" Diogenes did however adopt Antisthenes' teachings and the ascetic way of life, pursuing a life of self-sufficiency (autarkeia), austerity (askēsis), and shamelessness (anaideia) There are many anecdotes about his extreme asceticism (sleeping in a tub), his shameless behaviour (eating raw meat), and his criticism of conventional society (""bad people obey their lusts as servants obey their masters""), and although it is impossible to tell which of these stories are true, they do illustrate the broad character of the man, including an ethical seriousness",4
"    Crates of Thebes   Crates of Thebes (c365–c285 BC) is the third figure who dominates Cynic history He is notable because he renounced a large fortune to live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens He is said to have been a pupil of Diogenes, but again this is uncertainCrates married Hipparchia of Maroneia after she had fallen in love with him and together they lived like beggars on the streets of Athens, where Crates was treated with respect",4
"Crates' later fame (apart from his unconventional lifestyle) lies in the fact that he became the teacher of Zeno of Citium, the founder of StoicismThe Cynic strain to be found in early Stoicism (such as Zeno's own radical views on sexual equality spelled out in his Republic) can be ascribed to Crates' influence    Other Cynics   There were many other Cynics in the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE, including Onesicritus (who sailed with Alexander the Great to India), the skeptic Monimus, the moral satirist Bion of Borysthenes, the diatribist Teles and Menippus of Gadara",4
" However, with the rise of Stoicism in the 3rd century BCE, Cynicism as a serious philosophical activity underwent a decline, and it is not until the Roman era that Cynicism underwent a revival    Cynicism in the Roman world    There is little record of Cynicism in the 2nd or 1st centuries BCE; Cicero (c50 BCE), who was much interested in Greek philosophy, had little to say about Cynicism, except that ""it is to be shunned; for it is opposed to modesty, without which there can be neither right nor honor."" However, by the 1st century CE, Cynicism reappeared with full force",4
"The rise of Imperial Rome, like the Greek loss of independence under Philip and Alexander three centuries earlier, may have led to a sense of powerlessness and frustration among many people, which allowed a philosophy which emphasized self-sufficiency and inner-happiness to flourish once againCynics could be found throughout the empire, standing on street corners, preaching about virtueLucian complained that ""every city is filled with such upstarts, particularly with those who enter the names of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and Crates as their patrons and enlist in the Army of the Dog,"" and Aelius Aristides observed that ""they frequent the doorways, talking more to the doorkeepers than to the masters, making up for their lowly condition by using impudence."" The most notable representative of Cynicism in the 1st century CE was Demetrius, whom Seneca praised as ""a man of consummate wisdom, though he himself denied it, constant to the principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects."" Cynicism in Rome was both the butt of the satirist and the ideal of the thinker",4
"In the 2nd century CE, Lucian, whilst pouring scorn on the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus, nevertheless praised his own Cynic teacher, Demonax, in a dialogue.Cynicism came to be seen as an idealised form of Stoicism, a view which led Epictetus to eulogise the ideal Cynic in a lengthy discourse According to Epictetus, the ideal Cynic ""must know that he is sent as a messenger from Zeus to people concerning good and bad things, to show them that they have wandered.""  Unfortunately for Epictetus, many Cynics of the era did not live up to the ideal: ""consider the present Cynics who are dogs that wait at tables, and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance in breaking wind.""Unlike Stoicism, which declined as an independent philosophy after the 2nd century CE, Cynicism seems to have thrived into the 4th century",4
" The emperor, Julian (ruled 361–363), like Epictetus, praised the ideal Cynic and complained about the actual practitioners of CynicismThe final Cynic noted in classical history is Sallustius of Emesa in the late 5th century A student of the Neoplatonic philosopher Isidore of Alexandria, he devoted himself to living a life of Cynic asceticism    Cynicism and Christianity       Jesus as a Jewish Cynic   Some historians have noted the similarities between the teachings of Jesus and those of the Cynics",4
"Some scholars have argued that the Q document, a hypothetical common source for the gospels of Matthew and Luke, has strong similarities to the teachings of the CynicsScholars on the quest for the historical Jesus, such as Burton LMack and John Dominic Crossan of the Jesus Seminar, have argued that 1st-century AD Galilee was a world in which Hellenistic ideas collided with Jewish thought and traditionsThe city of Gadara, only a day's walk from Nazareth, was particularly notable as a centre of Cynic philosophy, and Mack has described Jesus as a ""rather normal Cynic-type figure.""  For Crossan, Jesus was more like a Cynic sage from a Hellenistic Jewish tradition than either a Christ who would die as a substitute for sinners or a messiah who wanted to establish an independent Jewish state of Israel",4
"Other scholars doubt that Jesus was deeply influenced by the Cynics and see the Jewish prophetic tradition as of much greater importance    Cynic influences on early Christianity   Many of the ascetic practices of Cynicism may have been adopted by early Christians, and Christians often employed the same rhetorical methods as the CynicsSome Cynics were martyred for speaking out against the authoritiesOne Cynic, Peregrinus Proteus, lived for a time as a Christian before converting to Cynicism, whereas in the 4th century, Maximus of Alexandria, although a Christian, was also called a Cynic because of his ascetic lifestyle",4
"Christian writers would often praise Cynic poverty, although they scorned Cynic shamelessness, Augustine stating that they had, ""in violation of the modest instincts of men, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless opinion, worthy indeed of dogs."" The ascetic orders of Christianity (such as the Desert Fathers) also had direct connection with the Cynics, as can be seen in the wandering mendicant monks of the early church, who in outward appearance and in many of their practices differed little from the Cynics of an earlier age",4
"Emmanuel College scholar Leif EVaage compared the commonalities between the Q document and Cynic texts, such as the Cynic epistlesThe epistles contain the wisdom and (often polemical) ethics preached by Cynics along with their sense of purity and aesthetic practices.During the 5th century, Crescens the Cynic clashed with Justin Martyr, recorded as claiming the Christians were atheotatous (“the most atheist ones”), in reference to their rejection of the pagan gods and their absence of temples, statues, or sacrifices",4

"A Doctor of Philosophy (PhD, Ph.D., or DPhil; Latin philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae) is the most common degree at the highest academic level awarded following a course of studyPhDs are awarded for programs across the whole breadth of academic fieldsBecause it is an earned research degree, those studying for a PhD are required to produce original research that expands the boundaries of knowledge, normally in the form of a thesis or dissertation, and defend their work before a panel of other experts in the field",4
"The completion of a PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university professor, researcher, or scientist in many fieldsIndividuals who have earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree may, in many jurisdictions, use the title Doctor (often abbreviated ""Dr"" or ""Dr."") with their name, although the proper etiquette associated with this usage may also be subject to the professional ethics of their own scholarly field, culture, or societyThose who teach at universities or work in academic, educational, or research fields are usually addressed by this title ""professionally and socially in a salutation or conversation."" Alternatively, holders may use post-nominal letters such as ""Ph.D."", ""PhD"", or ""DPhil"" (depending on the awarding institution)",4
"It is, however, considered incorrect to use both the title and post-nominals at the same time.The specific requirements to earn a PhD degree vary considerably according to the country, institution, and time period, from entry-level research degrees to higher doctoratesDuring the studies that lead to the degree, the student is called a doctoral student or PhD student; a student who has completed all their coursework and comprehensive examinations and is working on their thesis/dissertation is sometimes known as a doctoral candidate or PhD candidate (see: all but dissertation)",4
"A student attaining this level may be granted a Candidate of Philosophy degree at some institutions or may be granted a master's degree en route to the doctoral degreeSometimes this status is also colloquially known as ""PhD ABD,"" meaning ""All But Dissertation.""A PhD candidate must submit a project, thesis, or dissertation often consisting of a body of original academic research, which is in principle worthy of publication in a peer-reviewed journal",4
"In many countries, a candidate must defend this work before a panel of expert examiners appointed by the universityUniversities sometimes award other types of doctorate besides the PhD, such as the Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.) for music performers, Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) for legal scholars and the Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) for studies in educationIn 2005 the European Universities Association defined the ""Salzburg Principles,"" 10 basic principles for third-cycle degrees (doctorates) within the Bologna Process",4
"These were followed in 2016 by the ""Florence Principles,"" seven basic principles for doctorates in the arts laid out by the European League of Institutes of the Arts, which have been endorsed by the European Association of Conservatoires, the International Association of Film and Television Schools, the International Association of Universities and Colleges of Art, Design and Media, and the Society for Artistic Research.In the context of the Doctor of Philosophy and other similarly titled degrees, the term ""philosophy"" does not refer to the field or academic discipline of philosophy, but is used in a broader sense in accordance with its original Greek meaning, which is ""love of wisdom."" In most of Europe, all fields (history, philosophy, social sciences, mathematics, and natural philosophy/sciences) other than theology, law, and medicine (the so-called professional, vocational, or technical curriculum) were traditionally known as philosophy, and in Germany and elsewhere in Europe the basic faculty of liberal arts was known as the ""faculty of philosophy.""     Terminology   The degree is abbreviated PhD (sometimes Ph.D",4
"in the USA), from the Latin Philosophiae Doctor, pronounced as three separate letters (, PEE-aych-DEE)The abbreviation DPhil, from the English 'Doctor of Philosophy', is used by a small number of British and Commonwealth universities, including Oxford, formerly York, and Sussex, as the abbreviation for degrees from those institutions    History       Medieval and early modern Europe   In the universities of Medieval Europe, study was organized in four faculties: the basic faculty of arts, and the three higher faculties of theology, medicine, and law (canon law and civil law)",4
"All of these faculties awarded intermediate degrees (bachelor of arts, of theology, of laws, of medicine) and final degreesInitially, the titles of master and doctor were used interchangeably for the final degrees—the title Doctor was merely a formality bestowed on a Teacher/Master of the art—but by the late Middle Ages the terms Master of Arts and Doctor of Theology/Divinity, Doctor of Law, and Doctor of Medicine had become standard in most places (though in the German and Italian universities the term Doctor was used for all faculties)",4
"The doctorates in the higher faculties were quite different from the current PhD degree in that they were awarded for advanced scholarship, not original researchNo dissertation or original work was required, only lengthy residency requirements and examinationsBesides these degrees, there was the licentiateOriginally this was a license to teach, awarded shortly before the award of the master's or doctoral degree by the diocese in which the university was located, but later it evolved into an academic degree in its own right, in particular in the continental universities",4
"According to Keith Allan Noble (1994), the first doctoral degree was awarded in medieval Paris around 1150The doctorate of philosophy developed in Germany as the terminal teacher's credential in the 17th century (circa 1652)There were no PhDs in Germany before the 1650s (when they gradually started replacing the MA as the highest academic degree; arguably, one of the earliest German PhD holders is Erhard Weigel (Drphilhab., Leipzig, 1652).In theory, the full course of studies might, for example, lead in succession to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Licentiate of Arts, Master of Arts, or Bachelor of Medicine, Licentiate of Medicine, or Doctor of Medicine, but before the early modern era, many exceptions to this existed",4
"Most students left the university without becoming masters of arts, whereas regulars (members of monastic orders) could skip the arts faculty entirely    Educational reforms in Germany   This situation changed in the early 19th century through the educational reforms in Germany, most strongly embodied in the model of the University of Berlin, founded and controlled by the Prussian government in 1810The arts faculty, which in Germany was labelled the faculty of philosophy, started demanding contributions to research, attested by a dissertation, for the award of their final degree, which was labelled Doctor of Philosophy (abbreviated as Ph.D.)—originally this was just the German equivalent of the Master of Arts degree",4
"Whereas in the Middle Ages the arts faculty had a set curriculum, based upon the trivium and the quadrivium, by the 19th century it had come to house all the courses of study in subjects now commonly referred to as sciences and humanitiesProfessors across the humanities and sciences focused on their advanced researchPractically all the funding came from the central government, and it could be cut off if the professor was politically unacceptable.These reforms proved extremely successful, and fairly quickly the German universities started attracting foreign students, notably from the United States",4
"The American students would go to Germany to obtain a PhD after having studied for a bachelor's degrees at an American collegeSo influential was this practice that it was imported to the United States, where in 1861 Yale University started granting the PhD degree to younger students who, after having obtained the bachelor's degree, had completed a prescribed course of graduate study and successfully defended a thesis or dissertation containing original research in science or in the humanities",4
"In Germany, the name of the doctorate was adapted after the philosophy faculty started being split up − e.gDrrernatfor doctorates in the faculty of natural sciences − but in most of the English-speaking world the name ""Doctor of Philosophy"" was retained for research doctorates in all disciplinesThe PhD degree and similar awards spread across Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuriesThe degree was introduced in France in 1808, replacing diplomas as the highest academic degree; into Russia in 1819, when the Doktor Nauk degree, roughly equivalent to a PhD, gradually started replacing the specialist diploma, roughly equivalent to the MA, as the highest academic degree; and in Italy in 1927, when PhDs gradually started replacing the Laurea as the highest academic degree",4
"    History in the United Kingdom    Research degrees first appeared in the UK in the late 19th century in the shape of the Doctor of Science (DSc or ScD) and other such ""higher doctorates."" The University of London introduced the DSc in 1860, but as an advanced study course, following on directly from the BSc, rather than a research degreeThe first higher doctorate in the modern sense was Durham University's DSc, introduced in 1882",4
"This was soon followed by other universities, including the University of Cambridge establishing its ScD in the same year and the University of London transforming its DSc into a research degree in 1885These were, however, very advanced degrees, rather than research-training degrees at the PhD level—Harold Jeffreys said that getting a Cambridge ScD was ""more or less equivalent to being proposed for the Royal Society.""Finally, in 1917, the current PhD degree was introduced, along the lines of the American and German model, and quickly became popular with both British and foreign students",4
"The slightly older degrees of Doctor of Science and Doctor of Literature/Letters still exist at British universities; together with the much older degrees of Doctor of Divinity (DD), Doctor of Music (DMus), Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) and Doctor of Medicine (MD), they form the higher doctorates, but apart from honorary degrees, they are only infrequently awardedIn the English (but not the Scottish) universities, the Faculty of Arts had become dominant by the early 19th century",4
"Indeed, the higher faculties had largely atrophied, since medical training had shifted to teaching hospitals, the legal training for the common law system was provided by the Inns of Court (with some minor exceptions, see Doctors' Commons), and few students undertook formal study in theologyThis contrasted with the situation in the continental European universities at the time, where the preparatory role of the Faculty of Philosophy or Arts was to a great extent taken over by secondary education: in modern France, the Baccalauréat is the examination taken at the end of secondary studies",4
"The reforms at the Humboldt University transformed the Faculty of Philosophy or Arts (and its more recent successors such as the Faculty of Sciences) from a lower faculty into one on a par with the Faculties of Law and MedicineSimilar developments occurred in many other continental European universities, and at least until reforms in the early 21st century, many European countries (e.g., Belgium, Spain, and the Scandinavian countries) had in all faculties triple degree structures of bachelor (or candidate) − licentiate − doctor as opposed to bachelor − master − doctor; the meaning of the different degrees varied from country to country, however",4
"To this day, this is also still the case for the pontifical degrees in theology and canon law; for instance, in sacred theology, the degrees are Bachelor of Sacred Theology (STB), Licentiate of Sacred Theology (STL), and Doctor of Sacred Theology (STD), and in canon law: Bachelor of Canon Law (JCB), Licentiate of Canon Law (JCL), and Doctor of Canon Law (JCD)    History in the United States    Until the mid-19th century, advanced degrees were not a criterion for professorships at most colleges",4
"That began to change as the more ambitious scholars at major schools went to Germany for 1 to 3 years to obtain a PhD in the sciences or humanitiesGraduate schools slowly emerged in the United StatesIn 1861, Yale awarded the first three earned PhDs in North America to Eugene Schuyler, Arthur Williams Wright, and James Morris Whiton, although honorary PhDs had been awarded in the US for almost a decade, with Bucknell University awarding the first to Ebenezer Newton Elliott in 1852.In the next two decades, New York University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, and Princeton also began granting the degree",4
"Major shifts toward graduate education were foretold by the opening of Clark University in 1887 which offered only graduate programs and the Johns Hopkins University which focused on its PhD programBy the 1890s, Harvard, Columbia, Michigan and Wisconsin were building major graduate programs, whose alumni were hired by new research universitiesBy 1900, 300 PhDs were awarded annually, most of them by six universitiesIt was no longer necessary to study in Germany",4
"However, half of the institutions awarding earned PhDs in 1899 were undergraduate institutions that granted the degree for work done away from campusDegrees awarded by universities without legitimate PhD programs accounted for about a third of the 382 doctorates recorded by the US Department of Education in 1900, of which another 8–10% were honorary.At the start of the 20th century, US universities were held in low regard internationally and many American students were still traveling to Europe for PhDs",4
"The lack of centralised authority meant anyone could start a university and award PhDsThis led to the formation of the Association of American Universities by 14 leading research universities (producing nearly 90% of the approximately 250 legitimate research doctorates awarded in 1900), with one of the main goals being to ""raise the opinion entertained abroad of our own Doctor's Degree.""In Germany, the national government funded the universities and the research programs of the leading professors",4
"It was impossible for professors who were not approved by Berlin to train graduate studentsIn the United States, by contrast, private universities and state universities alike were independent of the federal governmentIndependence was high, but funding was lowThe breakthrough came from private foundations, which began regularly supporting research in science and history; large corporations sometimes supported engineering programsThe postdoctoral fellowship was established by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1919",4
"Meanwhile, the leading universities, in cooperation with the learned societies, set up a network of scholarly journals""Publish or perish"" became the formula for faculty advancement in the research universitiesAfter World War II, state universities across the country expanded greatly in undergraduate enrollment, and eagerly added research programs leading to masters or doctorate degreesTheir graduate faculties had to have a suitable record of publication and research grantsLate in the 20th century, ""publish or perish"" became increasingly important in colleges and smaller universities",4
"    Requirements    Detailed requirements for the award of a PhD degree vary throughout the world and even from school to schoolIt is usually required for the student to hold an Honours degree or a Master's Degree with high academic standing, in order to be considered for a PhD programIn the US, Canada, India, and Denmark, for example, many universities require coursework in addition to research for PhD degreesIn other countries (such as the UK) there is generally no such condition, though this varies by university and field",4
"Some individual universities or departments specify additional requirements for students not already in possession of a bachelor's degree or equivalent or higherIn order to submit a successful PhD admission application, copies of academic transcripts, letters of recommendation, a research proposal, and a personal statement are often requiredMost universities also invite for a special interview before admissionA candidate must submit a project, thesis, or dissertation often consisting of a body of original academic research, which is in principle worthy of publication in a peer-reviewed context",4
"Moreover, some PhD programs, especially in science, require one to three published articles in peer-reviewed journalsIn many countries, a candidate must defend this work before a panel of expert examiners appointed by the university; in other countries, the dissertation is examined by a panel of expert examiners who stipulate whether the dissertation is in principle passable and any issues that need to be addressed before the dissertation can be passedSome universities in the non-English-speaking world have begun adopting similar standards to those of the anglophone PhD degree for their research doctorates (see the Bologna process).A PhD student or candidate is conventionally required to study on campus under close supervision",4
"With the popularity of distance education and e-learning technologies, some universities now accept students enrolled into a distance education part-time modeIn a ""sandwich PhD"" program, PhD candidates do not spend their entire study period at the same universityInstead, the PhD candidates spend the first and last periods of the program at their home universities and in between conduct research at another institution or field researchOccasionally a ""sandwich PhD"" will be awarded by two universities",4
"    PhD confirmation   A PhD confirmation is a preliminary presentation or lecture that a PhD candidate presents to faculty and possibly other interested membersThe lecture follows after a suitable topic has been identified, and can include such matters as the aim of the research, methodology, first results, planned (or finished) publications, etcThe confirmation lecture can be seen as a trial run for the final public defense, though faculty members at this stage can still largely influence the direction of the research",4
"At the end of the lecture, the PhD candidate can be seen as ""confirmed"" – faculty members give their approval and trust that the study is well directed and will with high probability result in the candidate being successfulIn the United States, this is generally called advancing to Candidacy, the confirmation event being called the Candidacy Examination    Value and criticism   A career in academia generally requires a PhD, though, in some countries, it is possible to reach relatively high positions without a doctorate",4
"In North America, professors are increasingly being required to have a PhD, and the percentage of faculty with a PhD may be used as a university ratings measure.The motivation may also include increased salary, but in many cases, this is not the resultResearch by Bernard HCasey of the University of Warwick, U.K, suggests that, over all subjects, PhDs provide an earnings premium of 26% over non-accredited graduates, but notes that master's degrees already provide a premium of 23% and a bachelor's 14%",4
"While this is a small return to the individual (or even an overall deficit when tuition and lost earnings during training are accounted for), he claims there are significant benefits to society for the extra research trainingHowever, some research suggests that overqualified workers are often less satisfied and less productive at their jobsThese difficulties are increasingly being felt by graduates of professional degrees, such as law school, looking to find employment",4
"PhD students may need to take on debt to undertake their degree.A PhD is also required in some positions outside academia, such as research jobs in major international agenciesIn some cases, the Executive Directors of some types of foundations may be expected to hold a PhDA PhD is sometimes felt to be a necessary qualification in certain areas of employment, such as in foreign policy think-tanks: U.SNews wrote in 2013 that ""[i]f having a master's degree at the minimum is de rigueur in Washington's foreign policy world, it is no wonder many are starting to feel that the PhD is a necessary escalation, another case of costly signaling to potential employers."" Similarly, an article on the Australian public service states that ""credentialism in the public service is seeing a dramatic increase in the number of graduate positions going to PhDs and masters degrees becoming the base entry level qualification.""The Economist published an article in 2010 citing various criticisms against the state of PhDs",4
"These included a prediction by economist Richard BFreeman that, based on pre-2000 data, only 20% of life science PhD students would gain a faculty job in the U.S., and that in Canada 80% of postdoctoral research fellows earned less than or equal to an average construction worker ($38,600 a year)According to the article, only the fastest developing countries (e.gChina or Brazil) have a shortage of PhDs.The US higher education system often offers little incentive to move students through PhD programs quickly and may even provide incentive to slow them down",4
"To counter this problem, the United States introduced the Doctor of Arts degree in 1970 with seed money from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of TeachingThe aim of the Doctor of Arts degree was to shorten the time needed to complete the degree by focusing on pedagogy over research, although the Doctor of Arts still contains a significant research componentGermany is one of the few nations engaging these issues, and it has been doing so by reconceptualising PhD programs to be training for careers, outside academia, but still at high-level positions",4
"This development can be seen in the extensive number of PhD holders, typically from the fields of law, engineering, and economics, at the very top corporate and administrative positionsTo a lesser extent, the UK research councils have tackled the issue by introducing, since 1992, the EngD.Mark CTaylor opined in 2011 in Nature that total reform of PhD programs in almost every field is necessary in the U.Sand that pressure to make the necessary changes will need to come from many sources (students, administrators, public and private sectors, etc.)",4
"Other articles in Nature have also examined the issue of PhD reform.Freeman Dyson, professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, was opposed to the PhD system and did not have a PhD degreeOn the other hand, it was understood by all his peers that he was a world leading scientist with many accomplishments already under his belt during his graduate study years and he was eligible to gain the degree at any given moment",4
"    National variations   In German-speaking nations, most Eastern European nations, successor states of the former Soviet Union, most parts of Africa, Asia, and many Spanish-speaking countries, the corresponding degree to a Doctor of Philosophy is simply called ""Doctor"" (Doktor), and the subject area is distinguished by a Latin suffix (e.g., ""Drmed."" for Doctor medicinae, Doctor of Medicine; ""Drrernat."" for Doctor rerum naturalium, Doctor of the Natural Sciences; ""Drphil."" for Doctor philosophiae, Doctor of Philosophy; ""Dr",4
"iur."" for Doctor iuris, Doctor of Laws)    Degrees around the globe    The UNESCO, in its International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), states that: ""Programmes to be classified at ISCED level 8 are referred to in many ways around the world such as PhD, DPhil, D.Lit, D.Sc, LL.D, Doctorate or similar termsHowever, it is important to note that programmes with a similar name to 'doctor' should only be included in ISCED level 8 if they satisfy the criteria described in Paragraph 263",4
"For international comparability purposes, the term 'doctoral or equivalent' is used to label ISCED level 8.""     Argentina        Admission    In Argentina, the admission to a PhD program at public Argentine University requires the full completion of a Master's degree or a Licentiate degreeNon-Argentine Master's titles are generally accepted into a PhD program when the degree comes from a recognized university     Funding    While a significant portion of postgraduate students finance their tuition and living costs with teaching or research work at private and state-run institutions, international institutions, such as the Fulbright Program and the Organization of American States (OAS), have been known to grant full scholarships for tuition with apportions for housing.Others apply for funds to CONICET, the national public body of scientific and technical research, which typically awards more than a thousand scholarships each year for this purpose, thus guaranteeing many PhD candidates remain within the system",4
"     Requirements for completion    Upon completion of at least two years' research and coursework as a graduate student, a candidate must demonstrate truthful and original contributions to their specific field of knowledge within a frame of academic excellenceThe doctoral candidate's work should be presented in a dissertation or thesis prepared under the supervision of a tutor or director and reviewed by a Doctoral CommitteeThis committee should be composed of examiners that are external to the program, and at least one of them should also be external to the institution",4
"The academic degree of Doctor, respective to the correspondent field of science that the candidate has contributed with original and rigorous research, is received after a successful defense of the candidate's dissertation    Australia        Admission    Admission to a PhD program in Australia requires applicants to demonstrate capacity to undertake research in the proposed field of studyThe standard requirement is a bachelor's degree with either first-class or upper second-class honorsResearch master's degrees and coursework master's degrees with a 25% research component are usually considered equivalent",4
"It is also possible for research master's degree students to ""upgrade"" to PhD candidature after demonstrating sufficient progress     Scholarships    PhD students are sometimes offered a scholarship to study for their PhD degreeThe most common of these was the government-funded Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) until its dissolution in 2017It was replaced by Research Training Program (RTP), awarded to students of ""exceptional research potential,"" which provides a living stipend to students of approximately A$27,000 a year (tax-free)",4
"RTPs are paid for a duration of 3 years, while a 6-month extension is usually possible upon citing delays out of the control of the studentSome universities also fund a similar scholarship that matches the APA amountDue to a continual increase in living costs, many PhD students are forced to live under the poverty lineIn addition to the more common RTP and university scholarships, Australian students have other sources of scholarship funding, coming from industry, private enterprise, and organisations",4
"     Fees    Australian citizens, permanent residents, and New Zealand citizens are not charged course fees for their PhD or research master's degree, with the exception in some universities of the student services and amenities fee (SSAF) which is set by each university and typically involves the largest amount allowed by the Australian governmentAll fees are paid for by the Australian government, except for the SSAF, under the Research Training ProgramInternational students and coursework master's degree students must pay course fees unless they receive a scholarship to cover them",4
"     Requirements for completion    Completion requirements varyMost Australian PhD programs do not have a required coursework componentThe credit points attached to the degree are all in the product of the research, which is usually an 80,000-word thesis that makes a significant new contribution to the fieldRecent pressure on higher degree by research (HDR) students to publish has resulted in increasing interest in Ph.D by publication as opposed to the more traditional Ph.D by dissertation, which typically requires a minimum of two publications, but which also requires traditional thesis elements such as an introductory exegesis, and linking chapters between papers",4
"The PhD thesis is sent to external examiners who are experts in the field of research and who have not been involved in the workExaminers are nominated by the candidate's university, and their identities are often not revealed to the candidate until the examination is completeA formal oral defence is generally not part of the examination of the thesis, largely because of the distances that would need to be travelled by the overseas examiners; however, since 2016, there is a trend toward implementing this in many Australian universities",4
"At the University of South Australia, PhD candidates who started after January 2016 now undertake an oral defence via an online conference with two examiners    Canada        Admission    Admission to a doctoral programme at a Canadian university usually requires completion of a Master's degree in a related field, with sufficiently high grades and proven research abilityIn some cases, a student may progress directly from an Honours Bachelor's degree to a PhD program; other programs allow a student to fast-track to a doctoral program after one year of outstanding work in a Master's program (without having to complete the Master's)",4
"An application package typically includes a research proposal, letters of reference, transcripts, and in some cases, a writing sample or Graduate Record Examinations scoresA common criterion for prospective PhD students is the comprehensive or qualifying examination, a process that often commences in the second year of a graduate programGenerally, successful completion of the qualifying exam permits continuance in the graduate programFormats for this examination include oral examination by the student's faculty committee (or a separate qualifying committee), or written tests designed to demonstrate the student's knowledge in a specialized area (see below) or both",4
"At English-speaking universities, a student may also be required to demonstrate English language abilities, usually by achieving an acceptable score on a standard examination (for example the Test of English as a Foreign Language)Depending on the field, the student may also be required to demonstrate ability in one or more additional languagesA prospective student applying to French-speaking universities may also have to demonstrate some English language ability     Funding    While some students work outside the university (or at student jobs within the university), in some programs students are advised (or must agree) not to devote more than ten hours per week to activities (e.g., employment) outside of their studies, particularly if they have been given funding",4
"For large and prestigious scholarships, such as those from NSERC and Fonds québécois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies, this is an absolute requirementAt some Canadian universities, most PhD students receive an award equivalent to part or all of the tuition amount for the first four years (this is sometimes called a tuition deferral or tuition waiver)Other sources of funding include teaching assistantships and research assistantships; experience as a teaching assistant is encouraged but not requisite in many programs",4
"Some programs may require all PhD candidates to teach, which may be done under the supervision of their supervisor or regular facultyBesides these sources of funding, there are also various competitive scholarships, bursaries, and awards available, such as those offered by the federal government via NSERC, CIHR, or SSHRC     Requirements for completion    In general, the first two years of study are devoted to completion of coursework and the comprehensive examinationsAt this stage, the student is known as a ""PhD student"" or ""doctoral student."" It is usually expected that the student will have completed most of their required coursework by the end of this stage",4
"Furthermore, it is usually required that by the end of eighteen to thirty-six months after the first registration, the student will have successfully completed the comprehensive examsUpon successful completion of the comprehensive exams, the student becomes known as a ""PhD candidate."" From this stage on, the bulk of the student's time will be devoted to their own research, culminating in the completion of a PhD thesis or dissertationThe final requirement is an oral defense of the thesis, which is open to the public in some, but not all, universities",4
"At most Canadian universities, the time needed to complete a PhD degree typically ranges from four to six yearsIt is, however, not uncommon for students to be unable to complete all the requirements within six years, particularly given that funding packages often support students for only two to four years; many departments will allow program extensions at the discretion of the thesis supervisor or department chairAlternative arrangements exist whereby a student is allowed to let their registration in the program lapse at the end of six years and re-register once the thesis is completed in draft form",4
"The general rule is that graduate students are obligated to pay tuition until the initial thesis submission has been received by the thesis officeIn other words, if a PhD student defers or delays the initial submission of their thesis they remain obligated to pay fees until such time that the thesis has been received in good standing    Colombia        Admission    In Colombia, the PhD course admission may require a master's degree (Magíster) in some universities, specially public universities",4
"However, it could also be applied for a direct doctorate in specific cases, according to the jury's recommendations on the thesis proposal     Funding    Most of postgraduate students in Colombia must finance their tuition fees by means of teaching assistant seats or research worksSome institutions such as Colciencias, Colfuturo, CeiBA, and Icetex grant scholarships or provide awards in the form of forgivable loans     Requirements for completion    After two or two and a half years, it is expected that the research work of the doctoral candidate be submitted in the form of oral qualification, where suggestions and corrections about the research hypothesis and methodology, as well as on the course of the research work, are performed",4
"The PhD degree is only received after a successful defense of the candidate's thesis is performed (four or five years after the enrollment), most of the time also requiring the most important results having been published in at least one peer-reviewed high-impact international journal    Finland   In Finland, the degree of filosofian tohtori (abbreviated FT) is awarded by traditional universities, such as University of HelsinkiA Master's degree is required, and the doctorate combines approximately 4–5 years of research (amounting to 3–5 scientific articles, some of which must be first-author) and 60 ECTS points of studies",4
"Other universities such as Aalto University award degrees such as tekniikan tohtori (TkT, engineering), taiteen tohtori (TaT, art), etc., which are translated in English to Doctor of Science (D.Sc.), and they are formally equivalentThe licentiate (filosofian lisensiaatti or FL) requires only 2–3 years of research and is sometimes done before an FT    France        History     Before 1984 three research doctorates existed in France: the State doctorate (doctorat d'État, the old doctorate introduced in 1808), the third cycle doctorate (doctorat de troisième cycle, created in 1954 and shorter than the State doctorate) and the diploma of doctor-engineer (diplôme de docteur-ingénieur created in 1923), for technical research",4
"After 1984, only one type of doctoral degree remained, called ""doctorate"" (Doctorat)The latter is equivalent to the PhD     Admission    Students pursuing the PhD degree must first complete a master's degree program, which takes two years after graduation with a bachelor's degree (five years in total)The candidate must find funding and a formal doctoral advisor (Directeur de thèse) with a habilitation throughout the doctoral programThe PhD admission is granted by a graduate school (in French, ""école doctorale"")",4
"A PhD candidate can follow some in-service training offered by the graduate school while continuing their research in a laboratoryTheir research may be carried out in a laboratory, at a university, or in a companyIn the last case, the company hires the candidate and they are supervised by both the company's tutor and a lab's professorThe validation of the PhD degree requires generally 3 to 4 years after the master's degree",4
"     Funding    The financing of PhD research comes mainly from funds for research of the French Ministry of Higher Education and ResearchThe most common procedure is a short-term employment contract called doctoral contract: the institution of higher education is the employer and the PhD candidate the employeeHowever, the candidate can apply for funds from a company, which can host them at its premises (as in the case where PhD candidates do their research at a company)",4
"In another possible situation, the company and the institute can sign a funding agreement together so that the candidate still has a public doctoral contract but is works at the company on a daily basis (for example, this is particularly the case for the (French) Scientific Cooperation Foundation)Many other resources come from some regional/city projects, some associations, etc    Germany        Admission    In Germany, admission to a doctoral program is generally on the basis of having an advanced degree (i.e., a master's degree, diplom, magister, or staatsexamen), mostly in a related field and having above-average grades",4
"A candidate must also find a tenured professor from a university to serve as the formal advisor and supervisor (Betreuer) of the dissertation throughout the doctoral programThis supervisor is informally referred to as Doktorvater or Doktormutter, which literally translate to ""doctor's father"" and ""doctor's mother"" respectivelyThe formal admission is the beginning of the so-called Promotionsverfahren, while the final granting of the degree is called PromotionThe duration of the doctorate depends on the field",4
"A doctorate in medicine may take less than a full-time year to complete; those in other fields, two to six yearsMost doctorates are awarded with specific Latin designations for the field of research (except for engineering, where the designation is German), instead of a general name for all fields (such as the Ph.D.)The most important degrees are:  Drrernat(rerum naturalium; natural and formal sciences, i.ephysics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer science and information technology, or psychology); Dr",4

"As a title, the degree is commonly written in front of the name in abbreviated form, e.g., DrrernatMax Mustermann or DrMax Mustermann, dropping the designation entirelyHowever, leaving out the designation is only allowed when the doctorate degree is not an honorary doctorate, which must be indicated by Drh.c(from Latin honoris causa)While most German doctorates are considered equivalent to the PhD, an exception is the medical doctorate, where ""doctoral"" dissertations are often written alongside undergraduate study",4
"The European Research Council decided in 2010 that those doctorates do not meet the international standards of a PhD research degreeThere are different forms of university-level institution in Germany, but only professors from ""Universities"" (Univ.-Prof.) can serve as doctoral supervisors – ""Universities of Applied Sciences"" (Fachhochschulen) are not entitled to award doctorates, although some exceptions apply to this rule     Structure    Depending on the university, doctoral students (Doktoranden) can be required to attend formal classes or lectures, some of them also including exams or other scientific assignments, in order to get one or more certificates of qualification (Qualifikationsnachweise)",4

"This requirement was introduced in 2007 due to concerns about overseas terrorism and weapons proliferation     Funding    In the United Kingdom, funding for PhD students is sometimes provided by government-funded Research Councils or the European Social Fund, usually in the form of a tax-free bursary which consists of tuition fees together with a stipendTuition fees are charged at different rates for ""Home/EU"" and ""Overseas"" students, generally £3,000–£6,000 per year for the former and £9,000–14,500 for the latter (which includes EU citizens who have not been normally resident in the EEA for the last three years), although this can rise to over £16,000 at elite institutions",4
"Higher fees are often charged for laboratory-based degreesAs of 2020/21, the national indicative fee for PhD students is £4,407, increasing annually in line with GDP; there is no regulation of the fees charged by institutions, but if they charge a higher fee they may not require Research Council funded students to make up any difference themselves.As of 2020/21, the national minimum stipend for Research Council funded students is £15,285 per year, increasing annually in line with GDP",4
"The period of funding for a PhD project is between three and four years, depending on the rules of that funding council and the decisions of individual institutions, with extensions in funding of up to twelve months available to offset periods of absence for maternity leave, shared  parental leave, adoption leave, absences covered by a medical certificate, and extended  jury servicePhD work beyond this may be unfunded or funded from other sources",4
"A very small number of scientific studentships are sometimes paid at a higher rate – for example, in London, Cancer Research UK, the ICR and the Wellcome Trust stipend rates start at around £19,000 and progress annually to around £23,000 a year; an amount that is tax and national insurance freeResearch Council funding is distributed to Doctoral Training Partnerships and Centres for Doctoral Training, who are responsible for student selection, within the eligibility guidelines established by the Research Councils",4
"The ESRC (Economic and Social Science Research Council), for example, explicitly state that a 2.1 minimum (or a master's degree) is required.Many students who are not in receipt of external funding may choose to undertake the degree part-time, thus reducing the tuition feesThe tuition fee per annum for part-time PhD degrees are typically 50 - 60% of the equivalent full-time doctorateHowever, since the duration of a part-time PhD degree is longer than a full-time degree, the overall cost may be the same or higher",4
"The part-time PhD degree option provides free time in which to earn money for subsistenceStudents may also take part in tutoring, work as research assistants, or (occasionally) deliver lectures, at a rate of typically £12–14 per hour, either to supplement existing low income or as a sole means of funding     Completion     There is usually a preliminary assessment to remain in the program and the thesis is submitted at the end of a three- to four-year program",4
"These periods are usually extended pro rata for part-time studentsWith special dispensation, the final date for the thesis can be extended for up to four additional years, for a total of seven, but this is rare For full-time PhDs, a 4-year time limit has now been fixed and students must apply for an extension to submit a thesis past this pointSince the early 1990s, British funding councils have adopted a policy of penalising departments where large proportions of students fail to submit their theses in four years after achieving PhD-student status (or pro rata equivalent) by reducing the number of funded places in subsequent years",4
"Inadvertently, this leads to significant pressure on the candidate to minimise the scope of projects with a view on thesis submission, regardless of quality, and discourage time spent on activities that would otherwise further the impact of the research on the community (e.g., publications in high-impact journals, seminars, workshops)Furthermore, supervising staff are encouraged in their career progression to ensure that the PhD students under their supervision finalise the projects in three rather than the four years that the program is permitted to cover",4
"These issues contribute to an overall discrepancy between supervisors and PhD candidates in the priority they assign to the quality and impact of the research contained in a PhD project, the former favouring quick PhD projects over several students and the latter favouring a larger scope for their own ambitious project, training, and impact.There has recently been an increase in the number of Integrated PhD programs available, such as at the University of Southampton",4
"These courses include a Master of Research (MRes) in the first year, which consists of a taught component as well as laboratory rotation projectsThe PhD must then be completed within the next 3 yearsAs this includes the MRes all deadlines and timeframes are brought forward to encourage completion of both MRes and PhD within 4 years from commencementThese programs are designed to provide students with a greater range of skills than a standard PhD, and for the university, they are a means of gaining an extra years' fees from public sources",4
"     Other doctorates    In the United Kingdom, PhD degrees are distinct from other doctorates, most notably the higher doctorates such as DLitt (Doctor of Letters) or DSc (Doctor of Science), which may be granted on the recommendation of a committee of examiners on the basis of a substantial portfolio of submitted (and usually published) researchHowever, some UK universities still maintain the option of submitting a thesis for the award of a higher doctorate",4
"Recent years have seen the introduction of professional doctorates, which are the same level as PhDs but more specific in their fieldMost tend not to be solely academic, but combine academic research, a taught component or a professional qualificationThese are most notably in the fields of engineering (EngD), educational psychology (DEdPsych), occupational psychology (DOccPsych), clinical psychology (DClinPsych), health psychology (DHealthPsy), social work (DSW), nursing (DNP), public administration (DPA), business administration (DBA), and music (DMA)",4
"A more generic degree also used is DProf or ProfDThese typically have a more formal taught component consisting of smaller research projects, as well as a 40,000–60,000-word thesis component, which together are officially considered equivalent to a PhD degree    United States    In the United States, the PhD degree is the highest academic degree awarded by universities in most fields of studyThere are more than 282 universities in the United States that award the PhD degree, and those universities vary widely in their criteria for admission, as well as the rigor of their academic programs",4
"     Requirements    Typically, PhD programs require applicants to have a bachelor's degree in a relevant field (and, in many cases in the humanities, a master's degree), reasonably high grades, several letters of recommendation, relevant academic coursework, a cogent statement of interest in the field of study, and satisfactory performance on a graduate-level exam specified by the respective program (e.g., GRE, GMAT)     Duration, age structure, statistics (US)    Depending on the specific field of study, completion of a PhD program usually takes four to eight years of study after the Bachelor's Degree; those students who begin a PhD program with a master's degree may complete their PhD degree a year or two sooner",4
"As PhD programs typically lack the formal structure of undergraduate education, there are significant individual differences in the time taken to complete the degreeOverall, 57% of students who begin a PhD program in the US will complete their degree within ten years, approximately 30% will drop out or be dismissed, and the remaining 13% of students will continue on past ten years.The median age of PhD recipients in the US is 32 years",4
"While many candidates are awarded their degree in their 20s, 6% of PhD recipients in the US are older than 45 years.The number of PhD diplomas awarded by US universities has risen nearly every year since 1957, according to data compiled by the US National Science FoundationIn 1957, US universities awarded 8,611 PhD diplomas; 20,403 in 1967; 31,716 in 1977; 32,365 in 1987; 42,538 in 1997; 48,133 in 2007, and 55,006 in 2015",4
     Funding    PhD students at US universities typically receive a tuition waiver and some form of annual stipendMany US PhD students work as teaching assistants or research assistantsGraduate schools increasingly encourage their students to seek outside funding; many are supported by fellowships they obtain for themselves or by their advisers' research grants from government agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of HealthMany Ivy League and other well-endowed universities provide funding for the entire duration of the degree program (if it is short) or for most of it,4

"According to ""Guidelines for the recognition of Russian qualifications in the other European countries,"" in countries with a two-tier system of doctoral degrees (like Russian Federation, some post-Soviet states, Germany, Poland, Austria and Switzerland), should be considered for recognition at the level of the first doctoral degree, and in countries with only one doctoral degree, the degree of Kandidat Nauk should be considered for recognition as equivalent to this PhD degreeSince most education systems only have one advanced research qualification granting doctoral degrees or equivalent qualifications (ISCED 2011, par.270), the degree of Candidate of Sciences (Kandidat Nauk) of the former USSR countries is usually considered to be at the same level as the doctorate or PhD degrees of those countries.According to the Joint Statement by the Permanent Conference of the Ministers for Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany (Kultusministerkonferenz, KMK), German Rectors' Conference (HRK) and the Ministry of General and Professional Education of the Russian Federation, the degree of Kandidat Nauk is recognised in Germany at the level of the German degree of Doktor and the degree of Doktor Nauk at the level of German Habilitation",4
"The Russian degree of Kandidat Nauk is also officially recognised by the Government of the French Republic as equivalent to French doctorate.According to the International Standard Classification of Education, for purposes of international educational statistics, Kandidat Nauk (Candidate of Sciences) belongs to ISCED level 8, or ""doctoral or equivalent,"" together with PhD, DPhil, DLitt, DSc, LLD, Doctorate, or similarIt is mentioned in the Russian version of ISCED 2011 (par.262) on the UNESCO website as an equivalent to PhD belonging to this level",4

"Hindu philosophy encompasses the philosophies, world views and teachings of Hinduism that emerged in Ancient IndiaThese include six systems (shad-darśana) – Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and VedantaIn Indian tradition, the word used for philosophy is Darshana (Viewpoint or perspective), from the Sanskrit root drish (to see, to experience).These are also called the Astika (theistic) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the Vedas as an authoritative, important source of knowledge",4
"Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas, and these have been called nāstika (heterodox or non-orthodox) Indian philosophiesNāstika Indian philosophies include Buddhism, Jainism, Cārvāka, Ājīvika, and others.Western scholars have debated the relationship and differences within āstika philosophies and with nāstika philosophies, starting with the writings of Indologists and Orientalists of the 18th and 19th centuries, which were themselves derived from limited availability of Indian literature and medieval doxographies",4
"The various sibling traditions included in Hindu philosophies are diverse, and they are united by shared history and concepts, same textual resources, similar ontological and soteriological focus, and cosmologyWhile Buddhism and Jainism are considered distinct philosophies and religions, some heterodox (nāstika) traditions such as Cārvāka are often considered as distinct schools within Hindu philosophy because the word Hindu is also an exonym and historically, the term has also been used as a geographical and cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent.Hindu philosophy also includes several sub-schools of theistic philosophies that integrate ideas from two or more of the six orthodox philosophies, such as the realism of the Nyāya, the naturalism of the Vaiśeṣika, the dualism of the Sāṅkhya, the non-dualism and knowledge of Self as essential to liberation of Advaita, the self-discipline of Yoga and the asceticism and elements of theistic ideas",4
"Examples of such schools include Pāśupata Śaiva, Śaiva siddhānta, Pratyabhijña, Raseśvara and VaiṣṇavaSome sub-schools share Tantric ideas with those found in some Buddhist traditionsThe ideas of these sub-schools are found in the Puranas and Āgamas.Each school of Hindu philosophy has extensive epistemological literature called pramāṇaśāstras, as well as theories on metaphysics, axiology, and other topics    Classifications    In the history of India, the six orthodox schools had emerged before the start of the Common Era, and some schools emerged possibly even before the Buddha",4
"Some scholars have questioned whether the orthodox and heterodox schools classification is sufficient or accurate, given the diversity and evolution of views within each major school of Indian philosophy, with some sub-schools combining heterodox and orthodox views.Since ancient times, Indian philosophy has been categorized into āstika and nāstika schools of thoughtThe orthodox schools of Indian philosophy have been called ṣaḍdarśana (""six systems"")This schema was created between the 12th and 16th centuries by Vedantins.: 2–3  It was then adopted by the early Western Indologists, and pervades modern understandings of Indian philosophy.: 4–5      Āstika   There are six āstika (orthodox) schools of thought",4
"Each is called a darśana, and each darśana accepts the Vedas as authorityEach astika darsana also accepts the premise that Atman (eternal Self) existsThe āstika schools of philosophy are:  Samkhya – An strongly dualist theoretical exposition of consciousness and matter Agnostic with respect to God or the godsYoga – A monotheistic school which emerged from Sankhya and emphasizes practical use of Sankhya theory: meditation, contemplation and liberationNyāya or logic – The school of epistemology which explores sources of knowledge",4
"Vaiśeṣika – An empiricist school of atomismMīmāṃsā – An anti-ascetic and anti-mysticist school of orthopraxyThis school deals with the correct interpretation of the verses in VedasVedānta – The last segment of knowledge in the Vedas, or jñānakāṇḍa (section of knowledge)Vedanta is also referred as Uttara-MimamsaVedānta came to be the dominant current of Hinduism in the post-medieval period    Nāstika    Schools that do not accept the authority of the Vedas are nāstika philosophies, of which four nāstika (heterodox) schools are prominent: Cārvāka, a materialism school that accepted the existence of free will",4
"Ājīvika, a materialism school that denied the existence of free willBuddhism, a philosophy that denies existence of ātman (Self) and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of Gautama BuddhaJainism, a philosophy that accepts the existence of the ātman (Self), and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of twenty-four teachers known as tirthankaras, with Rishabha as the first and Mahavira as the twenty-fourth    Other schools   Besides the major orthodox and non-orthodox schools, there have existed syncretic sub-schools that have combined ideas and introduced new ones of their own",4
"The medieval scholar Vidyaranya (1238–1317 CE), in his book 'Sarva-Darshana-Samgraha', includes the following, along with Buddhism and Jainism, as sub-schools of Hindu philosophy:  Pashupata Shaivism, developed by Nakulisa Shaiva Siddhanta, the theistic Sankhya school Pratyabhijña, the recognitive school of Kashmir Shaivism, Trika Raseśvara, a Shaiva school that advocated the use of mercury to reach immortality The Ramanuja school The Pūrṇaprājña (Madhvācārya) school The PāṇinīyaThe above sub-schools introduced their own ideas while adopting concepts from orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy such as realism of the Nyāya, naturalism of Vaiśeṣika, monism and knowledge of Self (Atman) as essential to liberation of Advaita, self-discipline of Yoga, asceticism and elements of theistic ideas",4
"Some sub-schools share Tantric ideas with those found in some Buddhist traditions    Characteristics       Overview       Epistemology    Epistemology is called pramāṇaIt has been a key, much debated field of study in Hinduism since ancient timesPramāṇa is a hindu theory of knowledge and discusses the valid means by which human beings can gain accurate knowledgeThe focus of pramāṇa is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one doesn't, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.Ancient and medieval Hindu texts identify six pramāṇas as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths:   Pratyakṣa – Direct perception Anumāṇa – Inference or indirect perception Upamāṇa – Comparison and analogy Arthāpatti – Postulation, derivation from circumstances Anupalabdi – Non-perception, absence of proof Shabda – Word, testimony of past or present reliable expertsEach of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by the different schools",4
"The schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledgeFor example, the Cārvāka nāstika philosophy holds that only one (perception) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge, the Samkhya school holds that three are (perception, inference and testimony), while the Mīmāṃsā and Advaita schools hold that all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge    Sāmkhya    Samkhya is the oldest of the orthodox philosophical systems in Hinduism, with origins in the 1st millennium BCE",4
"It is a rationalist school of Indian philosophy, and had a strong influence on other schools of Indian philosophiesSāmkhya is an enumerationist philosophy whose epistemology accepted three of six pramāṇas as the only reliable means of gaining knowledgeThese were pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference) and sabda (Āptavacana, word/testimony of reliable sources).Samkhya school espouses dualism between witness-consciousness and 'nature' (mind, perception, matter)It regards the universe as consisting of two realities: Puruṣa (witness-consciousness) and prakriti ('nature')",4
"Jiva (a living being) is that state in which puruṣa is bonded to prakriti in some formThis fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of buddhi (awareness, intellect) and ahankara (individualized ego consciousness, “I-maker”)The universe is described by this school as one created by Purusa-Prakriti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.Samkhya philosophy includes a theory of gunas (qualities, innate tendencies, psyche)",4
"Guna, it states, are of three types: Sattva being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; Rajas guna is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and Tamas being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negativeEverything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three gunas, but in different proportionsThe interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life",4
"Samkhya theorises a pluralism of Selfs (Jeevatmas) who possess consciousnessSamkhya has historically been theistic or non-theistic, and there has been debate about its specific view on God.The Samkhya karika, one of the key texts of this school of Hindu philosophy, opens by stating its goal to be ""three kinds of human suffering"" and means to prevent themThe text then presents a distillation of its theories on epistemology, metaphysics, axiology and soteriology",4
"For example, it states,  The soteriology in Samkhya aims at the realization of Puruṣa as distinct from Prakriti; this knowledge of the Self is held to end transmigration and lead to absolute freedom (kaivalya)    Yoga    In Indian philosophy, Yoga is, among other things, the name of one of the six āstika philosophical schools The Yoga philosophical system aligns closely with the dualist premises of the Samkhya schoolThe Yoga school accepts Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of personal god (Ishvara), unlike Samkhya",4
"The epistemology of the Yoga school, like the Sāmkhya school, relies on three of six prāmaṇas as the means of gaining reliable knowledge: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference) and śabda (āptavacana, word/testimony of reliable sources).The universe is conceptualized as a duality in Yoga school: puruṣa (witness-consciousness) and prakṛti (mind, perception, matter); however, the Yoga school discusses this concept more generically as ""seer, experiencer"" and ""seen, experienced"" than the Samkhya school.A key text of the Yoga school is the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali",4
"Patanjali may have been, as Max Müller explains, ""the author or representative of the Yoga-philosophy without being necessarily the author of the Sutras."" Hindu philosophy recognizes many types of Yoga, such as rāja yoga, jñāna yoga, karma yoga, bhakti yoga, tantra yoga, mantra yoga, laya yoga, and hatha yoga.The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that jñāna (knowledge) is a sufficient means to mokshaIt suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha",4
"Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta, with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalismLike Advaita Vedanta, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy holds that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable, and that this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman (Self) and Brahman    Vaiśeṣika    The Vaiśeṣika philosophy is a naturalist schoolIt is a form of atomism in natural philosophy",4
"It postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to paramāṇu (atoms), and that one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherenceKnowledge and liberation are achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience, according to Vaiśeṣika schoolThe Vaiśeṣika darśana is credited to Kaṇāda Kaśyapa from the second half of the first millennium BCE",4
"The foundational text, the Vaiśeṣika Sūtra, opens as follows:  Dharma is that from which results the accomplishment of Exaltation and of the Supreme GoodThe authoritativeness of the Veda arises from its being an exposition of dharmaThe Supreme Good results from knowledge, produced from a particular dharma, of the essence of the Predicables, Substance, Attribute, Action, Genus, Species and Combination, by means of their resemblances and differences The Vaiśeṣika school is related to the Nyāya school but features differences in its epistemology, metaphysics and ontology",4
"The epistemology of the Vaiśeṣika school, like Buddhism, accepted only two means to knowledge as reliable – perception and inferenceThe Vaiśeṣika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vaiśeṣikas were the Vedas.Vaiśeṣika metaphysical premises are founded on a form of atomism, that reality is composed of four substances (earth, water, air, and fire)",4
"Each of these four are of two types: atomic (paramāṇu) and compositeAn atom is, according to Vaiśeṣika scholars, that which is indestructible (anitya), indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called “small” (aṇu)A composite, in this philosophy, is defined to be anything which is divisible into atomsWhatever human beings perceive is composite, while atoms are invisibleThe Vaiśeṣikas stated that size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements, their guṇa (quality), karma (activity), sāmānya (commonness), viśeṣa (particularity) and amavāya (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything)",4
"    Nyāya    The Nyāya school is a realist āstika philosophyThe school's most significant contributions to Indian philosophy were its systematic development of the theory of logic, methodology, and its treatises on epistemologyThe foundational text of the Nyāya school is the Nyāya Sūtras of the first millennium BCEThe text is credited to Aksapada Gautama and its composition is variously dated between the sixth and second centuries BCE.Nyāya epistemology accepts four out of six prāmaṇas as reliable means of gaining knowledge – pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference), upamāṇa (comparison and analogy) and śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).In its metaphysics, the Nyāya school is closer to the Vaiśeṣika school than the others",4
"It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge (notions and ignorance)Moksha (liberation), it states, is gained through right knowledgeThis premise led Nyāya to concern itself with epistemology, that is, the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notionsFalse knowledge is not merely ignorance to Naiyayikas; it includes delusionCorrect knowledge is discovering and overcoming one's delusions, and understanding the true nature of the soul, self and reality",4
"The Nyāya Sūtras begin:     Mīmāṃsā    The Mīmāṃsā school emphasized hermeneutics and exegesisIt is a form of philosophical realismKey texts of the Mīmāṃsā school are the Purva Mimamsa Sutras of JaiminiThe classical Mīmāṃsā school is sometimes referred to as pūrvamīmāṃsā or Karmamīmāṃsā in reference to the first part of the Vedas.The Mīmāṃsā school has several sub-schools defined by epistemologyThe Prābhākara subschool of Mīmāṃsā accepted five means to gaining knowledge as epistimetically reliable: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference), upamāṇa (comparison and analogy), arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), and śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts)",4
"The Kumārila Bhaṭṭa sub-school of Mīmāṃsā added a sixth way of knowing to its canon of reliable epistemology: anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).The metaphysics of the Mīmāṃsā school consists of both atheistic and theistic doctrines, and the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of GodRather, it held that the Self (Atma) is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, then focussed on the epistemology and metaphysics of dharma",4
"To them, dharma meant rituals and duties, not devas (gods), because devas existed only in nameThe Mīmāṃsākas held that the Vedas are ""eternal authorless infallible"", that Vedic vidhi (injunctions) and mantras in rituals are prescriptive karya (actions), and that the rituals are of primary importance and meritThey considered the Upanishads and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality to be of secondary importance, a philosophical view that the Vedanta school disagreed with.Mīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of philology and the philosophy of language",4
"While their deep analysis of language and linguistics influenced other schools, their views were not shared by othersMīmāṃsākas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly prescribe the proper, correct and rightIn contrast, Vedantins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also describe, develop and deriveMīmāṃsākas considered orderly, law-driven, procedural life as the central purpose and noblest necessity of dharma and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end",4
"The Mimamsa school was influential and foundational to the Vedanta school, with the difference that Mīmāṃsā developed and emphasized karmakāṇḍa (the portion of the śruti which relates to ceremonial acts and sacrificial rites, the early parts of the Vedas), while the Vedanta school developed and emphasized jñānakāṇḍa (the portion of the Vedas which relates to knowledge of monism, the latter parts of the Vedas)    Vedānta   The Vedānta school built upon the teachings of the Upanishads and Brahma Sutras from the first millennium BCE and is the most developed and best-known of the Hindu schools",4
"The epistemology of the Vedantins included, depending on the sub-school, five or six methods as proper and reliable means of gaining any form of knowledge: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference), upamāṇa (comparison and analogy), arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts)All of these have been further categorized by each sub-school of Vedanta in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error.The emergence of the Vedanta school represented a period in which a more knowledge-centered understanding began to emerge, focusing on jnana (knowledge) driven aspects of the Vedic religion and the Upanishads",4
"These included metaphysical concepts such as ātman and Brahman, and an emphasis on meditation, self-discipline, self-knowledge and abstract spirituality, rather than ritualismThe Upanishads were variously interpreted by ancient- and medieval-era Vedanta scholarsConsequently, the Vedanta separated into many sub-schools, ranging from theistic dualism to non-theistic monism, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own series of sub-commentaries    Advaita    Advaita literally means ""not two, sole, unity""It is a sub-school of Vedanta, and asserts spiritual and universal non-dualism",4
"Its metaphysics is a form of absolute monism, that is all ultimate reality is interconnected onenessThis is the oldest and most widely acknowledged Vedantic schoolThe foundational texts of this school are the Brahma Sutras and the early Upanishads from the 1st millennium BCEIts first great consolidator was the 8th century scholar Adi Shankara, who continued the line of thought of the Upanishadic teachers, and that of his teacher's teacher Gaudapada",4
"He wrote extensive commentaries on the major Vedantic scriptures and is celebrated as one of the major Hindu philosophers from whose doctrines the main currents of modern Indian thought are derived.According to this school of Vedanta, all reality is Brahman, and there exists nothing whatsoever which is not BrahmanIts metaphysics includes the concept of māyā and ātmanMāyā connotes ""that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal""",4
"The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore ""transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be""The concept of ātman is of one Atman, with the light of Atman reflected within each person as jivatmanAdvaita Vedantins assert that ātman is same as Brahman, and this Brahman is reflected within each human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually interconnected, and there is oneness in all of existence",4
"They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of māyā as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, sufferingJīvanmukti (liberation during life) can be achieved through Self-knowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as ātman in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality    Viśiṣṭādvaita    Ramanuja (c1037–1137) was the foremost proponent of the philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita or qualified non-dualism",4
"Viśiṣṭādvaita advocated the concept of a Supreme Being with essential qualities or attributesViśiṣṭādvaitins argued against the Advaitin conception of Brahman as an impersonal empty onenessThey saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was omnipresent and actively involved in existenceTo them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and a sign of ignoranceHowever, the individual's sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was derived from the universal beingness that is Brahman",4
"Ramanuja saw Vishnu as a personification of Brahman    Dvaita   Dvaita refers to a theistic sub-school in Vedanta tradition of Hindu philosophyAlso called as Tattvavāda and Bimbapratibimbavāda, the Dvaita sub-school was founded by the 13th-century scholar MadhvacharyaThe Dvaita Vedanta school believes that God (Vishnu, Paramatman) and the individual Selfs (Atman) (jīvātman) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct.Dvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the Vedas, espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities",4
"The first and the only independent reality, states the Dvaita school, is that of Vishnu or BrahmanVishnu is the Paramatman, in a manner similar to monotheistic God in other major religionsThe distinguishing factor of Dvaita philosophy, as opposed to monistic Advaita Vedanta, is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universeLike Vishishtadvaita Vedanta subschool, Dvaita philosophy also embraced Vaishnavism, with the metaphysical concept of Brahman in the Vedas identified with Vishnu and the one and only Supreme Being",4
"However, unlike Vishishtadvaita which envisions ultimate qualified nondualism, the dualism of Dvaita was permanent.Salvation, in Dvaita, is achievable only through the grace of God Vishnu    Dvaitādvaita (Bhedabheda)   Dvaitādvaita was proposed by Nimbarka, a 13th-century Vaishnava Philosopher from the Andhra regionAccording to this philosophy there are three categories of existence: Brahman, Self, and matterSelf and matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from BrahmanBrahman exists independently, while Self and matter are dependent",4
"Thus Self and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependentFurther, Brahman is a controller, the Self is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyedAlso, the highest object of worship is Krishna and his consort Radha, attended by thousands of gopis; of the Vrindavan; and devotion consists in self-surrender    Śuddhādvaita   Śuddhādvaita is the ""purely non-dual"" philosophy propounded by Vallabha Acharya (1479–1531)The founding philosopher was also the guru of the Vallabhā sampradāya (""tradition of Vallabh"") or Puṣṭimārga, a Vaishnava tradition focused on the worship of Krishna",4
"Vallabhacharya enunciates that Brahman has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Māyā (which itself is His power) and manifests Himself through the worldThat is why Shuddhadvaita is known as ‘Unmodified transformation’ or ‘Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda’Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual Selfs and the worldThe Jagat or Maya is not false or illusionary, the physical material world is",4
"Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a ‘part’ (but devoid of bliss) like sparks and fire    Acintya Bheda Abheda    Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534), stated that the Self or energy of God is both distinct and non-distinct from God, whom he identified as Krishna, Govinda, and that this, although unthinkable, may be experienced through a process of loving devotion (bhakti)He followed the Dvaita concept of MadhvacharyaThis philosophy of ""inconceivable oneness and difference""",4
"    Cārvāka    The Cārvāka school is one of the nāstika or ""heterodox"" philosophies It rejects supernaturalism, emphasizes materialism and philosophical skepticism, holding empiricism, perception and conditional inference as the proper source of knowledge Cārvāka is an atheistic school of thoughtIt holds that there is neither afterlife nor rebirth, all existence is mere combination of atoms and substances, feelings and mind are an epiphenomenon, and free will exists.Bṛhaspati is sometimes referred to as the founder of Cārvāka (also called Lokayata) philosophy",4
"Much of the primary literature of Carvaka, the Barhaspatya sutras (ca600 BCE), however, are missing or lostIts theories and development has been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras, sutras and the Indian epic poetry as well as from the texts of Buddhism and from Jain literatureThe Tattvôpaplava-siṁha by the skeptic philosopher Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa has been considered by many scholars to be an unorthodox Cārvāka text.One of the widely studied principles of Cārvāka philosophy was its rejection of inference as a means to establish valid, universal knowledge, and metaphysical truths",4
"In other words, the Cārvāka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional    Shaivism    Early history of Shaivism is difficult to determineHowever, the Śvetāśvatara Upanishad (400 – 200 BCE) is considered to be the earliest textual exposition of a systematic philosophy of ShaivismShaivism is represented by various philosophical schools, including non-dualist (abheda), dualist (bheda), and non-dualist-with-dualist (bhedābheda) perspectives",4
"Vidyaranya in his works mentions three major schools of Shaiva thought—Pashupata Shaivism, Shaiva Siddhanta and Pratyabhijña (Kashmir Shaivism)    Pāśupata Shaivism   Pāśupata Shaivism (Pāśupata, ""of Paśupati"") is the oldest of the major Shaiva schoolsThe philosophy of Pashupata sect was systematized by Lakulish in the 2nd century CEPaśu in Paśupati refers to the effect (or created world), the word designates that which is dependent on something ulteriorWhereas, Pati means the cause (or principium), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the pati, or the ruler",4
"Pashupatas disapproved of Vaishnava theology, known for its doctrine servitude of Selfs to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything could not be the means of cessation of pain and other desired endsThey recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselvesAccording to Pāśupatas, Self possesses the attributes of the Supreme Deity when it becomes liberated from the 'germ of every pain'.Pāśupatas divided the created world into the insentient and the sentient",4
"The insentient was the unconscious and thus dependent on the sentient or consciousThe insentient was further divided into effects and causesThe effects were of ten kinds, the earth, four elements and their qualities, colour etcThe causes were of thirteen kinds, the five organs of cognition, the five organs of action, the three internal organs, intellect, the ego principle and the cognising principleThese insentient causes were held responsible for the illusive identification of Self with non-Self",4
"Salvation in Pāśupata involved the union of the Self with God through the intellect    Shaiva Siddhanta   Considered normative Tantric Shaivism, Shaiva Siddhanta provides the normative rites, cosmology and theological categories of Tantric ShaivismBeing a dualistic philosophy, the goal of Shaiva Siddhanta is to become an ontologically distinct Shiva (through Shiva's grace)This tradition later merged with the Tamil Saiva movement and expression of concepts of Shaiva Siddhanta can be seen in the bhakti poetry of the Nayanars",4
"    Kashmir Shaivism   Kashmir Shaivism arose during the eighth or ninth century CE in Kashmir and made significant strides, both philosophical and theological, until the end of the twelfth century CEIt is categorised by various scholars as monistic idealism (absolute idealism, theistic monism, realistic idealism, transcendental physicalism or concrete monism)It is a school of Śaivism consisting of Trika and its philosophical articulation Pratyabhijña.Even though, both Kashmir Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta are non-dual philosophies which give primacy to Universal Consciousness (Chit or Brahman), in Kashmir Shavisim, as opposed to Advaita, all things are a manifestation of this Consciousness",4
"This implies that from the point of view of Kashmir Shavisim, the phenomenal world (Śakti) is real, and it exists and has its being in Consciousness (Chit)Whereas, Advaita holds that Brahman is the reality (pure consciousness) and it is inactive (niṣkriya) and the phenomenal world is an appearance (māyā)The objective of human life, according to Kashmir Shaivism, is to merge in Shiva or Universal Consciousness, or to realize one's already existing identity with Shiva, by means of wisdom, yoga and grace",4

"While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of Aristotle, general philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in the wake of the logical positivist movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing themCharles Sanders Peirce and Karl Popper moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology",4
"Thomas Kuhn's 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was also formative, challenging the view of scientific progress as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a ""paradigm"", the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.Subsequently, the coherentist approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to W.V",4
"Quine and othersSome thinkers such as Stephen Jay Gould seek to ground science in axiomatic assumptions, such as the uniformity of natureA vocal minority of philosophers, and Paul Feyerabend in particular, argue that there is no such thing as the ""scientific method"", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly supernatural onesAnother approach to thinking about science involves studying how knowledge is created from a sociological perspective, an approach represented by scholars like David Bloor and Barry Barnes",4
"Finally, a tradition in continental philosophy approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experiencePhilosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policyA central theme is whether the terms of one scientific theory can be intra- or intertheoretically reduced to the terms of anotherThat is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences",4
"For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statisticsThe question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicineAdditionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations",4
"    Introduction       Defining science    Distinguishing between science and non-science is referred to as the demarcation problemFor example, should psychoanalysis, creation science, and historical materialism be considered pseudosciences? Karl Popper called this the central question in the philosophy of science However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninterestingMartin Gardner has argued for the use of a Potter Stewart standard (""I know it when I see it"") for recognizing pseudoscience.Early attempts by the logical positivists grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless",4
" Popper argued that the central property of science is falsifiabilityThat is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science (though often times a fringe science becomes mainstream, even developing into a Paradigm Shift), or junk science",4
"Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term ""cargo cult science"" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of it but actually lack the ""kind of utter honesty"" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated    Scientific explanation    A closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanationIn addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide explanations for events that occur regularly or have already occurred",4
" Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has explanatory powerOne early and influential account of scientific explanation is deductive-nomological modelIt says that a successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific lawThis view has been subjected to substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory",4
"It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because it is a matter of chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is knownWesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explainedOthers have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism",4
"    Justifying science    Although it is often taken for granted, it is not at all clear how one can infer the validity of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful testsFor example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a rowThe chicken may therefore use inductive reasoning to infer that the farmer will bring food every morning",4
"However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chickenHow is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning? One approach is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probableSo the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain",4
"However, there remain difficult questions about the process of interpreting any given evidence into a probability that the general statement is trueOne way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.Some argue that what scientists do is not inductive reasoning at all but rather abductive reasoning, or inference to the best explanation",4
"In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observedAs discussed in the previous section, it is not always clear what is meant by the ""best explanation""Ockham's razor, which counsels choosing the simplest available explanation, thus plays an important role in some versions of this approachTo return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this heuristic principle more precise in terms of theoretical parsimony or other measures",4
"Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicityIn other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theoriesNicholas Maxwell has argued for some decades that unity rather than simplicity is the key non-empirical factor in influencing choice of theory in science, persistent preference for unified theories in effect committing science to the acceptance of a metaphysical thesis concerning unity in nature",4
" In order to improve this problematic thesis, it needs to be represented in the form of a hierarchy of theses, each thesis becoming more insubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy    Observation inseparable from theory    When making observations, scientists look through telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so onGenerally, on a basic level, they can agree on what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C",4
"But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observingFor example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted an image of the Einstein cross as five different objects in spaceIn light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides",4
"Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theoryObservations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.All observation involves both perception and cognitionThat is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory dataTherefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration",4
"In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden    The purpose of science    Should science aim to determine ultimate truth, or are there questions that science cannot answer?  Scientific realists claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard scientific theories as true, approximately true, or likely true Conversely, scientific anti-realists argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about unobservables like electrons or other universes",4
"Instrumentalists argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are usefulIn their view, whether theories are true or not is beside the point, because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technologyRealists often point to the success of recent scientific theories as evidence for the truth (or near truth) of current theories Antirealists point to either the many false theories in the history of science, epistemic morals, the success of false modeling assumptions, or widely termed postmodern criticisms of objectivity as evidence against scientific realism",4
" Antirealists attempt to explain the success of scientific theories without reference to truthSome antirealists claim that scientific theories aim at being accurate only about observable objects and argue that their success is primarily judged by that criterion    Values and science   Values intersect with science in different waysThere are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific researchThe scientific enterprise is embedded in particular culture and values through individual practitionersValues emerge from science, both as product and process and can be distributed among several cultures in the society",4
"When it comes to the justification of science in the sense of general public participation by single practitioners, science plays the role of a mediator between evaluating the standards and policies of society and its participating individuals, wherefore science indeed falls victim to vandalism and sabotage adapting the means to the end.If it is unclear what counts as science, how the process of confirming theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science",4
"Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensusFor example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time)Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science    History       Pre-modern   The origins of philosophy of science trace back to Plato and Aristotle who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of abductive, deductive, and inductive inference, and also analyzed reasoning by analogy",4
"The eleventh century Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied geometry, especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the reflection and refraction of lightRoger Bacon (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific methodHis view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time",4
"    Modern    Francis Bacon (no direct relation to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the Scientific RevolutionIn his work Novum Organum (1620)—an allusion to Aristotle's Organon—Bacon outlined a new system of logic to improve upon the old philosophical process of syllogismBacon's method relied on experimental histories to eliminate alternative theoriesIn 1637, René Descartes established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, Discourse on Method, advocating the central role of reason as opposed to sensory experience",4
"By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica argued that ""..hypotheses ..have no place in experimental philosophyIn this philosophy[,] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction."" This passage influenced a ""later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy""In particular, later in the 18th century, David Hume would famously articulate skepticism about the ability of science to determine causality and gave a definitive formulation of the problem of induction",4
" The 19th century writings of John Stuart Mill are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation    Logical positivism    Instrumentalism became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decadesLogical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences)",4
"Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920sInterpreting Ludwig Wittgenstein's early philosophy of language, logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness From Bertrand Russell's logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logicThey also embraced Russell's logical atomism, Ernst Mach's phenomenalism—whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychology—and Percy Bridgman's operationalism",4
"Thereby, only the verifiable was scientific and cognitively meaningful, whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless ""pseudostatements""—metaphysical, emotive, or such—not worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledgeLogical positivism is commonly portrayed as taking the extreme position that scientific language should never refer to anything unobservable—even the seemingly core notions of causality, mechanism, and principles—but that is an exaggeration Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical—direct observations viewed in the abstract—or at worst metaphysical or emotional",4
" Theoretical laws would be reduced to empirical laws, while theoretical terms would garner meaning from observational terms via correspondence rulesMathematics in physics would reduce to symbolic logic via logicism, while rational reconstruction would convert ordinary language into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a logical syntax A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a logical calculus or empirical operation could verify its falsity or truth",4
"In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with Otto Neurath's physicalism, and Rudolf Carnap had sought to replace verification with simply confirmation With World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, logical empiricism, led largely by Carl Hempel, in America, who expounded the covering law model of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of ""causation""",4
" The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of analytic philosophy, and dominated Anglosphere philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems, and its doctrines were increasingly assaultedNevertheless, it brought about the establishment of philosophy of science as a distinct subdiscipline of philosophy, with Carl Hempel playing a key role    Thomas Kuhn    In the 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a logically consistent ""portrait"" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing",4
"A paradigm also encompasses the set of questions and practices that define a scientific disciplineHe characterized normal science as the process of observation and ""puzzle solving"" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas revolutionary science occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift.Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently",4
"More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theoryEach paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretationsNeither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigmsFor Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them",4
"The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more ""portraits"" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promisingFor Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical processKuhn's position, however, is not one of relativismAccording to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them",4
"That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm    Current approaches       Naturalism's axiomatic assumptions   All scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processesKuhn concurs that all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts",4
"These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation  For naturalists, nature is the only reality, the only paradigm There is no such thing as 'supernatural' The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality, and Naturalism is the implicit philosophy of working scientists.The following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method",4
"that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers""The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality.""""As an individual we cannot know that the sensory information we perceive is generated artificially or originates from a real worldAny belief that it arises from a real world outside us is actually an assumptionIt seems more beneficial to assume that an objective reality exists than to live with solipsism, and so people are quite happy to make this assumption",4
"In fact we made this assumption unconsciously when we began to learn about the world as infantsThe world outside ourselves appears to respond in ways which are consistent with it being real ..The assumption of objectivism is essential if we are to attach the contemporary meanings to our sensations and feelings and make more sense of them."" ""Without this assumption, there would be only the thoughts and images in our own mind (which would be the only existing mind) and there would be no need of science, or anything else."" that this objective reality is governed by natural laws",4
"""Science, at least today, assumes that the universe obeys to knoweable principles that don't depend on time or place, nor on subjective parameters such as what we think, know or how we behave.""  Hugh Gauch argues that science presupposes that ""the physical world is orderly and comprehensible."" that reality can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentationStanley Sobottka said, ""The assumption of external reality is necessary for science to function and to flourish",4
"For the most part, science is the discovering and explaining of the external world."" ""Science attempts to produce knowledge that is as universal and objective as possible within the realm of human understanding."" that Nature has uniformity of laws and most if not all things in nature must have at least a natural cause Biologist Stephen Jay Gould referred to these two closely related propositions as the constancy of nature's laws and the operation of known processes",4
" Simpson agrees that the axiom of uniformity of law, an unprovable postulate, is necessary in order for scientists to extrapolate inductive inference into the unobservable past in order to meaningfully study itthat experimental procedures will be done satisfactorily without any deliberate or unintentional mistakes that will influence the resultsthat experimenters won't be significantly biased by their presumptionsthat random sampling is representative of the entire population A simple random sample (SRS) is the most basic probabilistic option used for creating a sample from a population",4
"The benefit of SRS is that the investigator is guaranteed to choose a sample that represents the population that ensures statistically valid conclusions    Coherentism    In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent systemOr, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justifiedA prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations",4
"As explained above, observation is a cognitive actThat is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefsAn observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanicsIf the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.In fact, according to the Duhem–Quine thesis, after Pierre Duhem and W.V",4
"Quine, it is impossible to test a theory in isolation One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictionsFor example, to test Newton's Law of Gravitation in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of Uranus in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets",4
"The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, NeptuneIf a test fails, something is wrongBut there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.One consequence of the Duhem–Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable ad hoc hypotheses",4
"Karl Popper accepted this thesis, leading him to reject naïve falsificationInstead, he favored a ""survival of the fittest"" view in which the most falsifiable scientific theories are to be preferred    Anything goes methodology    Paul Feyerabend (1924–1994) argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that there are no useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of science",4
"He argued that ""the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: anything goes"".Feyerabend said that science started as a liberating movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features, and thus had become increasingly an ideologyBecause of this, he said it was impossible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from religion, magic, or mythologyHe saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as authoritarian and ungrounded",4
"Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of ""the worst enemy of science"" from his detractors    Sociology of scientific knowledge methodology    According to Kuhn, science is an inherently communal activity which can only be done as part of a communityFor him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the way in which the communities functionOthers, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction",4
"For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplinesOn this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social constructHowever, some (such as Quine) do maintain that scientific reality is a social construct:  Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer ..",4
"For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwiseBut in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kindBoth sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural positsThe public backlash of scientists against such views, particularly in the 1990s, became known as the science wars.A major development in recent decades has been the study of the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists – including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, Ian Hacking and Anselm Strauss",4
"Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from economics have also been applied for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledgeThis interdisciplinary field has come to be known as science and technology studiesHere the approach to the philosophy of science is to study how scientific communities actually operate    Continental philosophy   Philosophers in the continental philosophical tradition are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science",4
"However, they have much to say about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical traditionFor example, Friedrich Nietzsche advanced the thesis in his The Genealogy of Morals (1887) that the motive for the search for truth in sciences is a kind of ascetic ideal In general, continental philosophy views science from a world-historical perspectiveGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) became one of the first philosophers to support this view",4
"Philosophers such as Pierre Duhem (1861-1916) and Gaston Bachelard (1884-1962) also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn's 1962 work by a generation or moreAll of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian ""life-world""), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as emphasised in the analytic traditionOne can trace this continental strand of thought through the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), the late works of Merleau-Ponty (Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France, 1956–1960), and the hermeneutics of Martin Heidegger (1889-1976).The largest effect on the continental tradition with respect to science came from Martin Heidegger's critique of the theoretical attitude in general, which of course includes the scientific attitude",4
"For this reason, the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical of the importance of science in human life and in philosophical inquiryNonetheless, there have been a number of important works: especially those of a Kuhnian precursor, Alexandre Koyré (1892-1964)Another important development was that of Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and scientific thought in The Order of Things (1966) and his study of power and corruption within the ""science"" of madness",4
"Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include Jürgen Habermas (e.g., Truth and Justification, 1998), Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker (The Unity of Nature, 1980; German: Die Einheit der Natur (1971)), and Wolfgang Stegmüller (Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschaftstheorie und Analytischen Philosophie, 1973–1986)    Other topics       Reductionism   Analysis involves breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in order to understand itReductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach",4
"One type of reductionism suggests that phenomena are amenable to scientific explanation at lower levels of analysis and inquiryPerhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physicsDaniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations",4
"    Social accountability    A broad issue affecting the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, what part of the world and of humankind are studied by sciencePhilip Kitcher in his Science, Truth, and Democracy argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science",4
"Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific    Philosophy of particular sciences   There is no such thing as philosophy-free science; there is only science whose philosophical baggage is taken on board without examinationIn addition to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences",4
They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questionsThe late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science    Philosophy of statistics    The problem of induction discussed above is seen in another form in debates over the foundations of statisticsThe standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable,4
"Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, under the assumption that the hypothesis being tested is trueIf the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsificationIn contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypothesesRelated topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation",4
"    Philosophy of mathematics    Philosophy of mathematics is concerned with the philosophical foundations and implications of mathematicsThe central questions are whether numbers, triangles, and other mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind and what is the nature of mathematical propositionsIs asking whether ""1+1 2"" is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was calculus invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires experience or reason alone",4
"What does it mean to prove a mathematical theorem and how does one know whether a mathematical proof is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and logic, human capabilities such as intuition, and the material universe    Philosophy of physics    Philosophy of physics is the study of the fundamental, philosophical questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interactThe main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism",4
"Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical lawsClassically, several of these questions were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time)    Philosophy of chemistry    Philosophy of chemistry is the philosophical study of the methodology and content of the science of chemistryIt is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams",4
"It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistryFor example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by quantum mechanics or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of how theories are confirmed in the context of confirming reaction mechanismsDetermining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directlyChemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of",4
"Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as chemical bonds    Philosophy of astronomy   The philosophy of astronomy seeks to understand and analyze the methodologies and technologies utilized by experts in the discipline, focusing on how observations made about space and astrophysical phenomena can be studiedGiven that astronomers rely and utilize theories and formulas from other scientific disciplines, such as chemistry and physics, the pursuit of understanding how knowledge can be obtained about the cosmos, as well as the relation in which our planet and Solar System have within our personal views of our place in the universe, philosophical insights into how facts about space can be scientifically analyzed and configure with other established knowledge is a main point of inquiry",4
"    Philosophy of Earth sciences   The philosophy of Earth science is concerned with how humans obtain and verify knowledge of the workings of the Earth system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere (solid earth)Earth scientists’ ways of knowing and habits of mind share important commonalities with other sciences, but also have distinctive attributes that emerge from the complex, heterogeneous, unique, long-lived, and non-manipulatable nature of the Earth system    Philosophy of biology    Philosophy of biology deals with epistemological, metaphysical, and ethical issues in the biological and biomedical sciences",4
"Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., Aristotle, Descartes, Leibniz and even Kant), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970sPhilosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from the rise of the modern synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in genetic engineering",4
"Other key ideas such as the reduction of all life processes to biochemical reactions as well as the incorporation of psychology into a broader neuroscience are also addressedResearch in current philosophy of biology includes investigation of the foundations of evolutionary theory (such as Peter Godfrey-Smith's work), and the role of viruses as persistent symbionts in host genomesAs a consequence, the evolution of genetic content order is seen as the result of competent genome editors in contrast to former narratives in which error replication events (mutations) dominated",4
"    Philosophy of medicine    Beyond medical ethics and bioethics, the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the epistemology and ontology/metaphysics of medicineWithin the epistemology of medicine, evidence-based medicine (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation, blinding and placebo controlsRelated to these areas of investigation, ontologies of specific interest to the philosophy of medicine include Cartesian dualism, the monogenetic conception of disease and the conceptualization of 'placebos' and 'placebo effects'",4
"There is also a growing interest in the metaphysics of medicine, particularly the idea of causationPhilosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, but also in the nature of such phenomenaCausation is of interest because the purpose of much medical research is to establish causal relationships, e.gwhat causes disease, or what causes people to get better    Philosophy of psychiatry    Philosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness",4
"The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatryThe first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadlyThe second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raisesThe third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology",4
"    Philosophy of psychology    Philosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern psychologySome of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigationFor example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured",4
"Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases in which there is no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responsesThen even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different thingsOther issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind",4
"For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychologyPhilosophy of psychology is a relatively young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s",4
"In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia ChurchlandPhilosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at allIt is concerned with questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism    Philosophy of social science    The philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the social sciences, such as sociology and cultural anthropology",4
"Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the natural sciences, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the ontological significance of structure and agencyThe French philosopher, Auguste Comte (1798–1857), established the epistemological perspective of positivism in The Course in Positivist Philosophy, a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842The first three volumes of the Course dealt chiefly with the natural sciences already in existence (geoscience, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of social science: ""sociologie""",4
"For Comte, the natural sciences had to necessarily arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex ""Queen science"" of human society itselfComte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general 'law of three stages'These are (1) the theological, (2) the metaphysical, and (3) the positive.Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and social research",4
"Durkheim, Marx, and Weber are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social scienceIn psychology, a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in behaviourismPositivism has also been espoused by 'technocrats' who believe in the inevitability of social progress through science and technology.The positivist perspective has been associated with 'scientism'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise",4
"Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular supportToday, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer bias and structural limitationsThis scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as Thomas Kuhn, and new philosophical movements such as critical realism and neopragmatismThe philosopher-sociologist Jürgen Habermas has critiqued pure instrumental rationality as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to ideology itself",4
"    Philosophy of technology    The philosophy of technology is a sub-field of philosophy that studies the nature of technologySpecific research topics include study of the role of tacit and explicit knowledge in creating and using technology, the nature of functions in technological artifacts, the role of values in design, and ethics related to technologyTechnology and engineering can both involve the application of scientific knowledgeThe philosophy of engineering is an emerging sub-field of the broader philosophy of technology",4
"Philosophy (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, 'love of wisdom') is the study of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and languageSuch questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolvedSome sources claim the term was coined by Pythagoras (c570 – c495 BCE); others dispute this story, arguing that Pythagoreans merely claimed use of a preexisting term Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher",4
"From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, ""natural philosophy"" encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physicsFor example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physicsIn the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specializeSince then, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, and namely the social sciences such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics",4
"Today, major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics, which is concerned with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; epistemology, which studies the nature of knowledge and belief; ethics, which is concerned with moral value; and logic, which studies the rules of inference that allow one to derive conclusions from true premisesOther notable subfields include philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind    Definitions   Initially, the term referred to any body of knowledge",4
"In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education, and politics.In section thirteen of his Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers, the oldest surviving history of philosophy (3rd century), Diogenes Laërtius presents a three-part division of ancient Greek philosophical inquiry: Natural philosophy (i.ephysics, from Greek: ta physika, lit. 'things having to do with physis [nature]') was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world",4
"Moral philosophy (i.eethics, from êthika, 'having to do with character, disposition, manners') was the study of goodness, right and wrong, justice and virtueMetaphysical philosophy (i.elogic, from logikós, 'of or pertaining to reason or speech') was the study of existence, causation, God, logic, forms, and other abstract objects(meta ta physika, 'after the Physics')In Against the Logicians the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus detailed the variety of ways in which the ancient Greek philosophers had divided philosophy, noting that this three-part division was agreed to by Plato, Aristotle, Xenocrates, and the Stoics",4
"The Academic Skeptic philosopher Cicero also followed this three-part division.This division is not obsolete, but has changed: natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences, especially physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, and cosmology; moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences, while still including value theory (e.gethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, etc.); and metaphysical philosophy has given way to formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and philosophy of science, while still including epistemology, cosmology, etc",4
"For example, Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1687), since classified as a book of physics, uses the term natural philosophy as it was understood at the time, encompassing disciplines such as astronomy, medicine and physics that later became associated with the sciences    Historical overview   In one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture, and a search for knowledgeIn this sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions, such as ""how are we to live"" and ""what is the nature of reality."" A broad and impartial conception of philosophy, then, finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality, morality, and life in all world civilizations",4
"    Western philosophy    Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world, dating back to pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in 6th-century Greece (BCE), such as Thales (c. 624 – c. 545 BCE) and Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE) who practiced a 'love of wisdom' (Latin: philosophia) and were also termed 'students of nature' (physiologoi)Western philosophy can be divided into three eras: Ancient (Greco-Roman)Medieval philosophy (referring to Christian European thought)",4
"Modern philosophy (beginning in the 17th century)     Ancient era    While our knowledge of the ancient era begins with Thales in the 6th century BCE, little is known about the philosophers who came before Socrates (commonly known as the pre-Socratics)The ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schoolsMost notable among the schools influenced by Socrates' teachings were Plato, who founded the Platonic Academy, and his student Aristotle, who founded the Peripatetic school",4
"Other ancient philosophical traditions influenced by Socrates included Cynicism, Cyrenaicism, Stoicism, and Academic SkepticismTwo other traditions were influenced by Socrates' contemporary, Democritus: Pyrrhonism and EpicureanismImportant topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics (with competing theories such as atomism and monism), cosmology, the nature of the well-lived life (eudaimonia), the possibility of knowledge, and the nature of reason (logos)With the rise of the Roman empire, Greek philosophy was increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca (see Roman philosophy)",4
"     Medieval era    Medieval philosophy (5th–16th centuries) is the period following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and hence reflects Judeo-Christian theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thoughtProblems such as the existence and nature of God, the nature of faith and reason, metaphysics, the problem of evil were discussed in this periodSome key medieval thinkers include StAugustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon",4
"Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to theology (ancilla theologiae) and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scriptureThis period saw the development of scholasticism, a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close reading and disputation on key textsThe Renaissance period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust humanism     Modern era     Early modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes (1596–1650)",4
"Following the rise of natural science, modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the ChurchMajor modern philosophers include Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant19th-century philosophy (sometimes called late modern philosophy) was influenced by the wider 18th-century movement termed ""the Enlightenment"", and includes figures such as Hegel a key figure in German idealism, Kierkegaard who developed the foundations for existentialism, Nietzsche a famed anti-Christian, John Stuart Mill who promoted utilitarianism, Karl Marx who developed the foundations for communism and the American William James",4
"The 20th century saw the split between analytic philosophy and continental philosophy, as well as philosophical trends such as phenomenology, existentialism, logical positivism, pragmatism and the linguistic turn (see Contemporary philosophy)    Middle Eastern philosophy        Pre-Islamic philosophy    The regions of the Fertile Crescent, Iran and Arabia are home to the earliest known philosophical wisdom literature and is today mostly dominated by Islamic cultureAccording to the assyriologist Marc Van De Mieroop, Babylonian philosophy was a highly developed system of thought with a unique approach to knowledge and a focus on writing, lexicography, divination, and law",4
"It was also a bilingual intellectual culture, based on Sumerian and Akkadian Early Wisdom Literature from the Fertile Crescent was a genre that sought to instruct people on ethical action, practical living, and virtue through stories and proverbsIn Ancient Egypt, these texts were known as sebayt ('teachings') and they are central to our understandings of Ancient Egyptian philosophyThe most well known of these texts is The Maxims of PtahhotepTheology and cosmology was a central concern in Egyptian thought",4
"Perhaps the earliest form of a monotheistic theology also emerged in Egypt, with the rise of the Amarna theology (or Atenism) of Akhenaten (14th century BCE), which held that the solar creation deity Aten was the only godThis has been described as a ""monotheistic revolution"" by egyptologist Jan Assmann, though it also drew on previous developments in Egyptian thought, particularly the ""New Solar Theology"" based around Amun-RaThese theological developments also influenced the post-Amarna Ramesside theology, which retained a focus on a single creative solar deity (though without outright rejection of other gods, which are now seen as manifestations of the main solar deity)",4
"This period also saw the development of the concept of the ba (soul) and its relation to god.Jewish philosophy and Christian philosophy are religious-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, which both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the Tanakh) and monotheistic beliefsJewish thinkers such as the Geonim of the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia and Maimonides engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophyLater Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of Moses Mendelssohn who ushered in the Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment), Jewish existentialism, and Reform Judaism",4
"The various traditions of Gnosticism, which were influenced by both Greek and Abrahamic currents, originated around the first century and emphasized spiritual knowledge (gnosis)Pre-Islamic Iranian philosophy begins with the work of Zoroaster, one of the first promoters of monotheism and of the dualism between good and evilThis dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as Manichaeism, Mazdakism, and Zurvanism     Islamic philosophy     Islamic philosophy is the philosophical work originating in the Islamic tradition and is mostly done in Arabic",4
"It draws from the religion of Islam as well as from Greco-Roman philosophyAfter the Muslim conquests, the translation movement (mid-eighth to the late tenth century) resulted in the works of Greek philosophy becoming available in Arabic.Early Islamic philosophy developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directionsThis intellectual work inaugurated what is known as the Islamic Golden AgeThe two main currents of early Islamic thought are Kalam, which focuses on Islamic theology, and Falsafa, which was based on Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism",4
"The work of Aristotle was very influential among philosophers such as Al-Kindi (9th century), Avicenna (980 – June 1037), and Averroes (12th century)Others such as Al-Ghazali were highly critical of the methods of the Islamic Aristotelians and saw their metaphysical ideas as hereticalIslamic thinkers like Ibn al-Haytham and Al-Biruni also developed a scientific method, experimental medicine, a theory of optics, and a legal philosophyIbn Khaldun was an influential thinker in philosophy of history",4
"Islamic thought also deeply influenced European intellectual developments, especially through the commentaries of Averroes on AristotleThe Mongol invasions and the destruction of Baghdad in 1258 is often seen as marking the end of the Golden AgeSeveral schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age, however, and include currents such as Illuminationist philosophy, Sufi philosophy, and Transcendent theosophyThe 19th- and 20th-century Arab world saw the Nahda movement (literally meaning 'The Awakening'; also known as the 'Arab Renaissance'), which had a considerable influence on contemporary Islamic philosophy",4
"    Eastern philosophy        Indian philosophy     Indian philosophy (Sanskrit: darśana, lit. 'point of view', 'perspective') refers to the diverse philosophical traditions that emerged since the ancient times on the Indian subcontinentIndian philosophical traditions share various key concepts and ideas, which are defined in different ways and accepted or rejected by the different traditionsThese include concepts such as dhárma, karma, pramāṇa, duḥkha, saṃsāra and mokṣaSome of the earliest surviving Indian philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE), which are considered to preserve the ideas of Brahmanism",4
"Indian philosophy is commonly grouped based on their relationship to the Vedas and the ideas contained in themJainism and Buddhism originated at the end of the Vedic period, while the various traditions grouped under Hinduism mostly emerged after the Vedic period as independent traditionsHindus generally classify Indian philosophical traditions as either orthodox (āstika) or heterodox (nāstika) depending on whether they accept the authority of the Vedas and the theories of brahman and ātman found therein.The schools which align themselves with the thought of the Upanishads, the so-called ""orthodox"" or ""Hindu"" traditions, are often classified into six darśanas or philosophies:Sānkhya, Yoga, Nyāya, Vaisheshika, Mimāmsā and Vedānta.The doctrines of the Vedas and Upanishads were interpreted differently by these six schools of Hindu philosophy, with varying degrees of overlap",4
"They represent a ""collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection,"" according to Chadha (2015)They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation.Hindu philosophers of the six orthodox schools developed systems of epistemology (pramana) and investigated topics such as metaphysics, ethics, psychology (guṇa), hermeneutics, and soteriology within the framework of the Vedic knowledge, while presenting a diverse collection of interpretationsThe commonly named six orthodox schools were the competing philosophical traditions of what has been called the ""Hindu synthesis"" of classical Hinduism.There are also other schools of thought which are often seen as ""Hindu"", though not necessarily orthodox (since they may accept different scriptures as normative, such as the Shaiva Agamas and Tantras), these include different schools of Shavism such as Pashupata, Shaiva Siddhanta, non-dual tantric Shavism (i.e",4
"Trika, Kaula, etc.) The ""Hindu"" and ""Orthodox"" traditions are often contrasted with the ""unorthodox"" traditions (nāstika, literally ""those who reject""), though this is a label that is not used by the ""unorthodox"" schools themselvesThese traditions reject the Vedas as authoritative and often reject major concepts and ideas that are widely accepted by the orthodox schools (such as Ātman, Brahman, and Īśvara)These unorthodox schools include Jainism (accepts ātman but rejects Īśvara, Vedas and Brahman), Buddhism (rejects all orthodox concepts except rebirth and karma), Cārvāka (materialists who reject even rebirth and karma) and Ājīvika (known for their doctrine of fate).Jain philosophy is one of the only two surviving ""unorthodox"" traditions (along with Buddhism)",4
"It generally accepts the concept of a permanent soul (jiva) as one of the five astikayas (eternal, infinite categories that make up the substance of existence)The other four being dhárma, adharma, ākāśa ('space'), and pudgala ('matter')Jain thought holds that all existence is cyclic, eternal and uncreated.Some of the most important elements of Jain philosophy are the Jain theory of karma, the doctrine of nonviolence (ahiṃsā) and the theory of ""many-sidedness"" or Anēkāntavāda",4
"The Tattvartha Sutra is the earliest known, most comprehensive and authoritative compilation of Jain philosophy     Buddhist philosophy     Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of Gautama Buddha (flbetween 6th and 4th century BCE) and is preserved in the early Buddhist textsIt originated in the Indian region of Magadha and later spread to the rest of the Indian subcontinent, East Asia, Tibet, Central Asia, and Southeast AsiaIn these regions, Buddhist thought developed into different philosophical traditions which used various languages (like Tibetan, Chinese and Pali)",4
"As such, Buddhist philosophy is a trans-cultural and international phenomenonThe dominant Buddhist philosophical traditions in East Asian nations are mainly based on Indian Mahayana BuddhismThe philosophy of the Theravada school is dominant in Southeast Asian countries like Sri Lanka, Burma and ThailandBecause ignorance to the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering (dukkha), Buddhist philosophy is concerned with epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychologyBuddhist philosophical texts must also be understood within the context of meditative practices which are supposed to bring about certain cognitive shifts.: 8  Key innovative concepts include the four noble truths as an analysis of dukkha, anicca (impermanence), and anatta (non-self).After the death of the Buddha, various groups began to systematize his main teachings, eventually developing comprehensive philosophical systems termed Abhidharma.: 37  Following the Abhidharma schools, Indian Mahayana philosophers such as Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu developed the theories of śūnyatā ('emptiness of all phenomena') and vijñapti-matra ('appearance only'), a form of phenomenology or transcendental idealism",4
"The Dignāga school of pramāṇa ('means of knowledge') promoted a sophisticated form of Buddhist epistemologyThere were numerous schools, sub-schools, and traditions of Buddhist philosophy in ancient and medieval IndiaAccording to Oxford professor of Buddhist philosophy Jan Westerhoff, the major Indian schools from 300 BCE to 1000 CE were:: xxiv  the Mahāsāṃghika tradition (now extinct), the Sthavira schools (such as Sarvāstivāda, Vibhajyavāda and Pudgalavāda) and the Mahayana schoolsMany of these traditions were also studied in other regions, like Central Asia and China, having been brought there by Buddhist missionaries",4
"After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, some of these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the Tibetan Buddhist, East Asian Buddhist and Theravada Buddhist traditions     East Asian philosophy     East Asian philosophical thought began in Ancient China, and Chinese philosophy begins during the Western Zhou Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the ""Hundred Schools of Thought"" flourished (6th century to 221 BCE)This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China such as Confucianism (also known as Ruism), Legalism, and Taoism as well as numerous other less influential schools like Mohism and Naturalism",4
"These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such Tao, Yin and yang, Ren and LiThese schools of thought further developed during the Han (206 BCE – 220 CE) and Tang (618–907 CE) eras, forming new philosophical movements like Xuanxue (also called Neo-Taoism), and Neo-ConfucianismNeo-Confucianism was a syncretic philosophy, which incorporated the ideas of different Chinese philosophical traditions, including Buddhism and TaoismNeo-Confucianism came to dominate the education system during the Song dynasty (960–1297), and its ideas served as the philosophical basis of the imperial exams for the scholar official class",4
"Some of the most important Neo-Confucian thinkers are the Tang scholars Han Yu and Li Ao as well as the Song thinkers Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073) and Zhu Xi (1130–1200)Zhu Xi compiled the Confucian canon, which consists of the Four Books (the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, the Analects of Confucius, and the Mencius)The Ming scholar Wang Yangming (1472–1529) is a later but important philosopher of this tradition as well",4
"Buddhism began arriving in China during the Han Dynasty, through a gradual Silk road transmission and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/Zen) which spread throughout the East Asian cultural sphereChinese culture was highly influential on the traditions of other East Asian states and its philosophy directly influenced Korean philosophy, Vietnamese philosophy and Japanese philosophyDuring later Chinese dynasties like the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean Joseon dynasty (1392–1897) a resurgent Neo-Confucianism led by thinkers such as Wang Yangming (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state",4
"In Japan, the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867) was also strongly influenced by Confucian philosophyConfucianism continues to influence the ideas and worldview of the nations of the Chinese cultural sphere todayIn the Modern era, Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophyChinese Marxist philosophy developed under the influence of Mao Zedong, while a Chinese pragmatism developed under Hu ShihThe old traditional philosophies also began to reassert themselves in the 20th century",4
"For example, New Confucianism, led by figures such as Xiong Shili, has become quite influentialLikewise, Humanistic Buddhism is a recent modernist Buddhist movementModern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences (Rangaku) and the modernist Meirokusha intellectual society which drew from European enlightenment thought and promoted liberal reforms as well as Western philosophies like Liberalism and UtilitarianismAnother trend in modern Japanese philosophy was the ""National Studies"" (Kokugaku) tradition",4
"This intellectual trend sought to study and promote ancient Japanese thought and cultureKokugaku thinkers such as Motoori Norinaga sought to return to a pure Japanese tradition which they called Shinto that they saw as untainted by foreign elementsDuring the 20th century, the Kyoto School, an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school developed from Western phenomenology and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of Dogen    African philosophy    African philosophy is philosophy produced by African people, philosophy that presents African worldviews, ideas and themes, or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods",4
"Modern African thought has been occupied with Ethnophilosophy, with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be African.During the 17th century, Ethiopian philosophy developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by Zera YacobAnother early African philosopher was Anton Wilhelm Amo (c1703–1759) who became a respected philosopher in GermanyDistinct African philosophical ideas include Ujamaa, the Bantu idea of 'Force', Négritude, Pan-Africanism and Ubuntu",4
"Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of Africana philosophy, the philosophical literature of the African diaspora which includes currents such as black existentialism by African-AmericansSome modern African thinkers have been influenced by Marxism, African-American literature, Critical theory, Critical race theory, Postcolonialism and Feminism    Indigenous American philosophy    Indigenous-American philosophical thought consists of a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among different American culturesAmong some of U.S",4
"Native American communities, there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the 'Great Spirit'  (Siouan: wakȟáŋ tȟáŋka; Algonquian: gitche manitou)Another widely shared concept was that of orenda ('spiritual power')According to Whiteley (1998), for the Native Americans, ""mind is critically informed by transcendental experience (dreams, visions and so on) as well as by reason."" The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed shamanismAnother feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants.In Mesoamerica, Nahua philosophy was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called tlamatini ('those who know something') and its ideas are preserved in various Aztec codices and fragmentary texts",4
"Some of these philosophers are known by name, such as Nezahualcoyotl, Aquiauhtzin, Xayacamach, Tochihuitzin coyolchiuhqui and Cuauhtencoztli These authors were also poets and some of their work has survived in the original Nahuatl.Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aestheticsAztec ethics was focused on seeking tlamatiliztli ('knowledge', 'wisdom') which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua proverb ""the middle good is necessary."" The Nahua worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called Ōmeteōtl ('Dual Cosmic Energy') which sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing, ""slippery"" world",4
"The theory of Teotl can be seen as a form of PantheismAccording to James Maffie, Nahua metaphysics posited that teotl is ""a single, vital, dynamic, vivifying, eternally self-generating and self-conceiving as well as self-regenerating and self-reconceiving sacred energy or force."" This force was seen as the all encompassing life force of the universe and as the universe itself The Inca civilization also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the amawtakuna or amautas who were important in the Inca education system as teachers of philosophy, theology, astronomy, poetry, law, music, morality and history",4
"Young Inca nobles were educated in these disciplines at the state college of Yacha-huasi in Cuzco, where they also learned the art of the quipuIncan philosophy (as well as the broader category of Andean thought) held that the universe is animated by a single dynamic life force (sometimes termed camaquen or camac, as well as upani and amaya)This singular force also arises as a set of dual complementary yet opposite forces",4
"These “complementary opposites” are called yanantin and masintinThey are expressed as various polarities or dualities (such as male–female, dark–light, life and death, above and below) which interdependently contribute to the harmonious whole that is the universe through the process of reciprocity and mutual exchange called ayniThe Inca worldview also included the belief in a creator God (Viracocha) and reincarnation    Women in philosophy    Although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse, women philosophers have engaged in the discipline throughout history",4
"Ancient examples include Hipparchia of Maroneia (active c. 325 BCE) and Arete of Cyrene (active 5th–4th centuries BCE)Some women philosophers were accepted during the medieval and modern eras, but none became part of the Western canon until the 20th and 21st century, when many suggest that G.E.MAnscombe, Hannah Arendt, Simone de Beauvoir, and Susanne Langer entered the canon.In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and the US began admitting women, producing more female academics",4
"Nevertheless, U.SDepartment of Education reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the humanities, with women making up somewhere between 17% and 30% of philosophy faculty according to some studies    Philosophical progress   Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated todayBritish philosopher Colin McGinn claims that no philosophical progress has occurred during that interval",4
"Australian philosopher David Chalmers, by contrast, sees progress in philosophy similar to that in scienceMeanwhile, Talbot Brewer, professor of philosophy at University of Virginia, argues that ""progress"" is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity    Branches of philosophy   Philosophical questions can be grouped into various branchesThese groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions",4
"These divisions are neither exhaustive, nor mutually exclusive(A philosopher might specialize in Kantian epistemology, or Platonic aesthetics, or modern political philosophy)Furthermore, these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science, religion or mathematics    Aesthetics    Aesthetics is the ""critical reflection on art, culture and nature."" It addresses the nature of art, beauty and taste, enjoyment, emotional values, perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty",4
"It is more precisely defined as the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of sentiment and tasteIts major divisions are art theory, literary theory, film theory and music theoryAn example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the Cubist aesthetic    Ethics    Ethics, also known as moral philosophy, studies what constitutes good and bad conduct, right and wrong values, and good and evil",4
"Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of moralityIt also includes investigating whether or not there is a best way to live or a universal moral standard, and if so, how we come to learn about itThe main branches of ethics are normative ethics, meta-ethics and applied ethics.The three main views in ethics about what constitute moral actions are: Consequentialism, which judges actions based on their consequences",4
"One such view is utilitarianism, which judges actions based on the net happiness (or pleasure) and/or lack of suffering (or pain) that they produceDeontology, which judges actions based on whether or not they are in accordance with one's moral dutyIn the standard form defended by Immanuel Kant, deontology is concerned with whether or not a choice respects the moral agency of other people, regardless of its consequencesVirtue ethics, which judges actions based on the moral character of the agent who performs them and whether they conform to what an ideally virtuous agent would do",4
"    Epistemology    Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledgeEpistemologists examine putative sources of knowledge, including perceptual experience, reason, memory, and testimonyThey also investigate questions about the nature of truth, belief, justification, and rationality.Philosophical skepticism, which raises doubts about some or all claims to knowledge, has been a topic of interest throughout the history of philosophyIt arose early in Pre-Socratic philosophy and became formalized with Pyrrho, the founder of the earliest Western school of philosophical skepticism",4
"It features prominently in the works of modern philosophers René Descartes and David Hume, and has remained a central topic in contemporary epistemological debates.One of the most notable epistemological debates is between empiricism and rationalismEmpiricism places emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledgeEmpiricism is associated with a posteriori knowledge, which is obtained through experience (such as scientific knowledge)Rationalism places emphasis on reason as a source of knowledge",4
"Rationalism is associated with a priori knowledge, which is independent of experience (such as logic and mathematics)One central debate in contemporary epistemology is about the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge, which might include truth and justificationThis debate was largely the result of attempts to solve the Gettier problemAnother common subject of contemporary debates is the regress problem, which occurs when trying to offer proof or justification for any belief, statement, or proposition",4
"The problem is that whatever the source of justification may be, that source must either be without justification (in which case it must be treated as an arbitrary foundation for belief), or it must have some further justification (in which case justification must either be the result of circular reasoning, as in coherentism, or the result of an infinite regress, as in infinitism)    Metaphysics    Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality, such as existence, time, objects and their properties, wholes and their parts, events, processes and causation and the relationship between mind and body",4

"Political philosophy or political theory is the philosophical study of government, addressing questions about the nature, scope, and legitimacy of public agents and institutions and the relationships between themIts topics include politics, liberty, justice, property, rights, law, and the enforcement of laws by authority: what they are, if they are needed, what makes a government legitimate, what rights and freedoms it should protect, what form it should take, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever",4
"Political science is generally used in the singular, but in French and Spanish the plural (sciences politiques and ciencias políticas, respectively) is used, perhaps a reflection of the discipline's eclectic nature.Political theory also engages questions of a broader scope, tackling the political nature of phenomena and categories such as identity, culture, sexuality, race, wealth, human-nonhuman relations, ecology, religion, and morePolitical philosophy is a branch of philosophy, but it has also been a major part of political science, within which a strong focus has historically been placed on both the history of political thought and contemporary political theory (from normative political theory to various critical approaches)",4
"In the Oxford Handbook of Political Theory (2009), the field is described as: ""[...] an interdisciplinary endeavor whose center of gravity lies at the humanities end of the happily still undisciplined discipline of political science ..For a long time, the challenge for the identity of political theory has been how to position itself productively in three sorts of location: in relation to the academic disciplines of political science, history, and philosophy; between the world of politics and the more abstract, ruminative register of theory; between canonical political theory and the newer resources (such as feminist and critical theory, discourse analysis, film and film theory, popular and political culture, mass media studies, neuroscience, environmental studies, behavioral science, and economics) on which political theorists increasingly draw.""

"Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra NeetiAn example of a code of law in ancient India is the Manusmṛti or Laws of Manu     Ancient China     Chinese political philosophy dates back to the Spring and Autumn period, specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BCChinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period",4
"The major philosophies during the period, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Agrarianism and Taoism, each had a political aspect to their philosophical schoolsPhilosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophiesConfucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationshipsLegalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and lawsMohism advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and asceticism",4

"Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states, which experimented with various forms of political organization, grouped by Plato into five categories of descending stability and morality: monarchy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyrannyOne of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato's Republic, which was followed by Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics and PoliticsRoman political philosophy was influenced by the Stoics and the Roman statesman Cicero    Medieval Christianity        Saint Augustine    The early Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo was heavily influenced by Plato",4
"A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the Stoicism and theory of justice of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying mercy as a moral exampleAugustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the City of God (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man (Civitas Terrena)Augustine's City of God is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on Earth",4
"     StThomas Aquinas     Thomas Aquinas meticulously dealt with the varieties of philosophy of lawAccording to Aquinas, there are four kinds of law:  Eternal law (""the divine government of everything"") Divine positive law (having been ""posited"" by God; external to human nature) Natural law (the right way of living discoverable by natural reason; what cannot-not be known; internal to human nature) Human law (what we commonly call ""law""—including customary law; the law of the Communitas Perfecta)Aquinas never discusses the nature or categorization of canon law",4
"There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential frameworkAquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the Natural Law tradition    Islamic Political Evolution        Mutazilite vsAsharite     The rise of Islam, based on both the Qur'an and Muhammad strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean regionEarly Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion, and the process of ijtihad to find truth—in effect all philosophy was ""political"" as it had real implications for governance",4
"This view was challenged by the ""rationalist"" Mutazilite philosophers, who held a more Hellenic view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the CaliphateBy the late ancient period, however, the ""traditionalist"" Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphedAccording to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna",4
" Islamic political philosophy, was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of Islam—i.e., the Qur'an and the Sunnah, the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocraticHowever, in Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: al-Kindi (Alkindus), al-Farabi (Abunaser), İbn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Bajjah (Avempace) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes)The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), sultan, ummah, cemaa (obligation)-and even the ""core"" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., ibadah (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and ilah (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis",4
"Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other jurists and ulama posed political ideas and theoriesFor example, the ideas of the Khawarij in the very early years of Islamic history on Khilafa and Ummah, or that of Shia Islam on the concept of Imamah are considered proofs of political thoughtThe clashes between the Ehl-i Sunna and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character",4
"Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, howeverAristotleanism flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the peripatetic philosophers who implemented the ideas of Aristotle in the context of the Islamic worldAbunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelationThey believed, for example, that natural phenomena occur because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).Other notable political philosophers of the time include Nizam al-Mulk, a Persian scholar and vizier of the Seljuq Empire who composed the Siyasatnama, or the ""Book of Government"" in English",4
"In it, he details the role of the state in terms of political affairs (i.ehow to deal with political opponents without ruining the government's image), as well as its duty to protect the poor and reward the worthyIn his other work, he explains how the state should deal with other issues such as supplying jobs to immigrants like the Turkmens who were coming from the north (present day southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan)",4
"     Ibn Khaldun    The 14th-century Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun is considered one of the greatest political theoristsThe British philosopher-anthropologist Ernest Gellner considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of government, ""...an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself,"" the best in the history of political theoryFor Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men    Medieval Europe   Medieval political philosophy in Europe was heavily influenced by Christian thinking",4
"It had much in common with the Mutazilite Islamic thinking in that the Roman Catholics thought subordinating philosophy to theology did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of IslamThe Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of StAugustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelationPerhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St",4
"Thomas Aquinas who helped reintroduce Aristotle's works, which had only been transmitted to Catholic Europe through Muslim Spain, along with the commentaries of AverroesAquinas's use of them set the agenda, for scholastic political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the Renaissance.Some medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in his Summa Theologica, developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown",4
"Others, like Nicole Oresme in his Livre de Politiques, categorically denied this right to overthrow an unjust rulerThe Magna Carta, viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice's sakeOther documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary    European Renaissance   During the Renaissance secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe",4
"While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire, the academic field was wholly scholastic and therefore Christian in nature     Niccolò Machiavelli    One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince, written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's deathThat work, as well as The Discourses, a rigorous analysis of classical antiquity, did much to influence modern political thought in the West",4
"A minority (including Jean-Jacques Rousseau) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from FlorenceThough the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the Medici familyAt any rate, Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the acquisition and maintenance of absolute power",4
"Thomas Hobbes, well known for his theory of the social contract, goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the English RenaissanceAlthough neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individualIt was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order",4
"    European Enlightenment   During the Enlightenment period, new theories emerged about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the English Civil War, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Haitian Revolution)These new theories led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Benjamin Constant and Jean-Jacques Rousseau",4
"These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could beThese fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of ""state"" and ""government."" It was decided that ""state"" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justifiedThe term ""government"" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound",4
"This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science, although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political termsAs long as the concept of natural order was not introduced, the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking",4
"Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the guild was subordinated to the theory of free trade, and Roman Catholic dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by Protestant churches subordinate to each nation-state, which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region",4
"Free trade, as opposed to these religious theories, is a trade policy that does not restrict imports or exportsIt can also be understood as the free market idea applied to international tradeIn government, free trade is predominantly advocated by political parties that hold liberal economic positions while economically left-wing and nationalist political parties generally support protectionism, the opposite of free tradeHowever, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity",4
"The most outspoken critic of the church in France was François Marie Arouet de Voltaire, a representative figure of the enlightenmentHistorians have described Voltaire's description of the history of Christianity as ""propagandistic"".Voltaire is partially responsible for the misattribution of the expression Credo quia absurdum to the Church FathersIn a letter to Frederick II, King of Prussia, dated 5 January 1767, he wrote about Christianity: La nôtre [religion] est sans contredit la plus ridicule, la plus absurde, et la plus sanguinaire qui ait jamais infecté le monde",4
"""Ours [i.e., the Christian religion] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this worldYour Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think",4
"..My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out."" After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the New World and the advanced civilizations of the Aztec, Maya, Inca, Mohican, Delaware, Huron and especially the IroquoisThe Iroquois philosophy, in particular, gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the United States: for example, Benjamin Franklin was a great admirer of some of the methods of the Iroquois Confederacy, and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives",4
"The Iroquois (/ˈɪrəkwɔɪ/ or /ˈɪrəkwɑː/) or Haudenosaunee are a historically powerful northeast Native American confederacy in North AmericaThey were known during the colonial years to the French as the Iroquois League, and later as the Iroquois Confederacy, and to the English as the Five Nations, comprising the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and SenecaAfter 1722, they accepted the Tuscarora people from the Southeast into their confederacy, as they were also Iroquoian-speaking, and became known as the Six Nations",4
"     John Locke    John Locke in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work Two Treatises of GovernmentIn it, Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligationLocke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system",4
"The theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated itUnlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animalUnlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin, Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa",4
"For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderationAccording to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man     John Stuart Mill    John Stuart Mill's work on political philosophy begins in On Liberty, On Liberty is the most influential statement of his liberal principles",4
"He begins by distinguishing old and new threats to libertyThe old threat to liberty is found in traditional societies in which there is rule by one (a monarchy) or a few (an aristocracy)Though one could be worried about restrictions on liberty by benevolent monarchs or aristocrats, the traditional worry is that when rulers are politically unaccountable to the governed they will rule in their own interests, rather than the interests of the governed",4
"Mill's explicit theory of rights is introduced in Chapter V of Utilitarianism in the context of his sanction theory of duty, which is an indirect form of utilitarianism that identifies wrong actions as actions that it is useful to sanctionMill then introduces justice as a proper part of the dutyJustice involves duties that are perfect duties—that is, duties that are correlated with rightsJustice implies something which it is not only right to do, and wrong not to do, but which some individual person can claim from us as a matter of right",4
"These perfect duties will thus create liberty and collective freedom within a stateHe uses, On Liberty to discuss gender equality in societyTo Mill, Utilitarianism was the perfect tool to justify gender equality in The Subjection of Women, referring to the political, lawful and social subjection of womenWhen a woman was married, she entered legally binding coverture with her husband; once she married her legal existence as an individual was suspended under ""marital unity""",4
"While it is easy to presume that a woman would not marry under these circumstances, being unmarried had social consequencesA woman could only advance in social stature and wealth if she had a rich husband to do the groundworkMill uses his Utilitarian ethics to assess how gender equality would be the best way to achieve ""the greatest good for the greatest number"" : ""The principle that regulates the existing social relations between the two sexes … and is now one of the chief obstacles to human improvement…"" The ‘chief obstacle’ to Mill relates to women's intellectual capability",4
"The Subjection of Women looks at this in the women of society and argues that diminishing their intellectual potential wastes the knowledge and skill of half of the population; such knowledge lost could formulate ideas that could maximize pleasure for society     Benjamin Constant     One of the first thinkers to go by the name of ""liberal"", Constant looked to Britain rather than to ancient Rome for a practical model of freedom in a large, commercial society",4
"He drew a distinction between the ""Liberty of the Ancients"" and the ""Liberty of the Moderns""The Liberty of the Ancients was participatory republican liberty, which gave the citizens the right to directly influence politics through debates and votes in the public assemblyIn order to support this degree of participation, citizenship was a burdensome moral obligation requiring a considerable investment of time and energyGenerally, this required a sub-society of slaves to do much of the productive work, leaving the citizens free to deliberate on public affairs",4
"Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous societies, in which the people could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairsThe Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of civil liberties, the rule of law, and freedom from excessive state interferenceDirect participation would be limited: a necessary consequence of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a commercial society in which there are no slaves but almost everybody must earn a living through work",4
"Instead, the voters would elect representatives, who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from the necessity of daily political involvementMoreover, Constant believed that, in the modern world, commerce was superior to warHe attacked Napoleon's martial appetite, on the grounds that it was illiberal and no longer suited to modern commercial social organizationAncient Liberty tended to be warlike, whereas a state organized on the principles of Modern Liberty would be at peace with all peaceful nations",4
"     Thomas Hobbes    The main practical conclusion of Hobbes' political theory is that state or society can not be secure unless at the disposal of an absolute sovereignFrom this follows the view that no individual can hold rights of property against the sovereign, and that the sovereign may therefore take the goods of its subjects without their consentIn Leviathan, Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of states and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality",4
"Much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil warBeginning from a mechanistic understanding of human beings and their passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the state of natureIn that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the worldThis, Hobbes argues, would lead to a ""war of all against all""",4
"     Jean-Jacques Rousseau    The Social Contract outlines the basis for a legitimate political order within a framework of classical republicanismPublished in 1762, it became one of the most influential works of political philosophy in the Western traditionIt developed some of the ideas mentioned in earlier work, the article Économie Politique (Discourse on Political Economy), featured in Diderot's EncyclopédieThe treatise begins with the dramatic opening lines, ""Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains",4
"Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they."" Rousseau claimed that the state of nature was a primitive condition without law or morality, which human beings left for the benefits and necessity of cooperationAs society developed, the division of labor and private property required the human race to adopt institutions of lawIn the degenerate phase of society, man is prone to be in frequent competition with his fellow men while also becoming increasingly dependent on them",4
"This double pressure threatens both his survival and his freedom    Industrialization and the modern era   The Marxist critique of capitalism—developed with Friedrich Engels—was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth centuryThe industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thoughtUrbanization and capitalism greatly reshaped societyDuring this same period, the socialist movement began to formIn the mid-19th century, Marxism was developed, and socialism in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class",4
"Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, and Fidel CastroThough Hegel's philosophy of history is similar to Immanuel Kant's, and Karl Marx's theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was ""standing on its head"", ""the right side up again""",4
"Unlike Marx who believed in historical materialism, Hegel believed in the Phenomenology of SpiritBy the late 19th century, socialism and trade unions were established members of the political landscapeIn addition, the various branches of anarchism, with thinkers such as Mikhail Bakunin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon or Peter Kropotkin, and syndicalism also gained some prominenceIn the Anglo-American world, anti-imperialism and pluralism began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.World War I was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics",4
"The Russian Revolution of 1917 (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought communism—and in particular the political theory of Leninism, but also on a smaller level Luxemburgism (gradually)—on the world stageAt the same time, social democratic parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of universal suffrage    Contemporary    From the end of World War II until 1971, when John Rawls published A Theory of Justice, political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and behavioralism",4
"In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with Marxism dominating the fieldThis was the time of Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser; and the victories of Mao Zedong in China and Fidel Castro in Cuba, as well as the events of May 1968, led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the New LeftA number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including Karl Popper, Friedrich Hayek, Leo Strauss, Hannah Arendt, Isaiah Berlin, Eric Voegelin and Judith Shklar—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s, they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment",4
"Communism remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960sColonialism and racism were important issues that aroseIn general, there was a marked trend towards a pragmatic approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical oneMuch academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply utilitarianism to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as rational choice theory) to political issues",4
"The rise of feminism, LGBT social movements and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as African Americans and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, postcolonial, and multicultural thought becoming significantThis led to a challenge to the social contract by philosophers Charles WMills in his book The Racial Contract and Carole Pateman in her book The Sexual Contract that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively",4
"In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of John Rawls's A Theory of Justice in 1971 is considered a milestoneRawls used a thought experiment, the original position, in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignoranceRawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justiceRobert Nozick's 1974 book Anarchy, State, and Utopia, which won a National Book Award, responded to Rawls from a libertarian perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe, several new lines of philosophy directed at the critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s",4
"Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasisOut of the Frankfurt School, thinkers like Herbert Marcuse, Theodor WAdorno, Max Horkheimer, and Jürgen Habermas combined Marxian and Freudian perspectivesAlong somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on structuralism and on a ""return to Hegel""Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Claude Lefort, and Jean Baudrillard",4
"The Situationists were more influenced by Hegel; Guy Debord, in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of commodity fetishism to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formationAnother debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by Michael Walzer, Michael Sandel and Charles TaylorThe liberal-communitarian debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective",4
"These and other communitarians (such as Alasdair MacIntyre and Daniel ABell) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focusCommunitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of social capitalA prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of deliberative democracyThe seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in Germany, but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as Jane Mansbridge, Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are republicanism (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the capability approach",4
"The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from Isaiah Berlin's positive and negative forms of liberty, namely ""liberty as non-domination.""

"The Philosophy of 'As if': A System of the Theoretical, Practical and Religious Fictions of Mankind (German: Die Philosophie des Als Ob) is a 1911 book by the German philosopher Hans Vaihinger, based on his dissertation of 1877The work for which Vaihinger is best known, it was published in an English translation by CKOgden in 1924In 1935, a revised and abbreviated English translation by Ogden was publishedThe revised translation was based on the sixth German edition of the original work",4
"    Summary   Vaihinger begins with an autobiography, discussing the origins of his philosophical ideasHe writes that he chose the title The Philosophy of 'As If because ""it seemed to me to express more convincingly than any other possible title"" his view that, ""appearance, the consciously-false, plays an enormous part in science, in world-philosophies and in life.""The book presents an epistemology as well as a practical world and life viewVaihinger describes human knowledge as erroneous and contradictory and asks how to explain the fact that one can still arrive at the right thing based on these false assumptions",4
"Vaihinger's answer is that the assumptions are a practically useful fiction, and that knowledge can therefore only be pragmatically substantiated by the success that is achieved in its applicationReligious and metaphysical views, like logic, are not true in an objective sense, since this cannot be establishedInstead, the question had to be asked whether it was useful to act ""as if"" they were true    Reception    The Philosophy of 'As if' influenced both Sigmund Freud since his 1913 letter to Sándor Ferenczi, and Alfred Adler in his 1912 book Über den nervösen Charakter",4
"Grundzüge einer vergleichenden Individualpsychologie und Psychotherapie (English translation: The Neurotic ConstitutionOutlines of a Comparative Individualistic Psychology and Psychotherapy)Though it contained the first use of the term ""logical positivism"", the logical positivists were generally dismissive of the workThe philosopher Moritz Schlick wrote that Vaihinger's description of his philosophy as a form of ""idealist positivism"" was one of its many contradictions.The American journalist HLMencken was scathing in his criticism of the book, which he dismissed as an unimportant ""foot-note to all existing systems""",4
"Michael JInwood writes that Vaihinger's theory ""involves familiar, though not necessarily insurmountable, difficulties""He finds it open to criticism on the grounds that it involves a covert appeal to a non-pragmatic concept of truthHe also notes that the theory implies that claims about the utility of holding doctrines and even the theory itself are no more than useful fictions.In his biography, Philosopher at Large, Mortimer JAdler notes that this book was one of his influences on his first book, Dialectic",4
"Western philosophy encompasses the philosophical thought and work of the Western worldHistorically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of Western culture, beginning with the ancient Greek philosophy of the pre-SocraticsThe word philosophy itself originated from the Ancient Greek philosophía (φιλοσοφία), literally, ""the love of wisdom"" Ancient Greek: φιλεῖν phileîn, ""to love"" and σοφία sophía, ""wisdom"")     History       Ancient   The scope of ancient Western philosophy included the problems of philosophy as they are understood today; but it also included many other disciplines, such as pure mathematics and natural sciences such as physics, astronomy, and biology (Aristotle, for example, wrote on all of these topics)",4
"     Pre-Socratics    The pre-Socratic philosophers were interested in cosmology; the nature and origin of the universe, while rejecting mythical answers to such questionsThey were specifically interested in the arche (the cause or first principle) of the worldThe first recognized philosopher, Thales of Miletus (born c. 625 BCE in Ionia) identified water as the arche (claiming ""all is water"")His use of observation and reason to derive this conclusion is the reason for distinguishing him as the first philosopher",4
"Thales' student Anaximander claimed that the arche was the apeiron, the infiniteFollowing both Thales and Anaximander, Anaximenes of Miletus claimed that air was the most suitable candidate Pythagoras (born c. 570 BCE), from the island of Samos off the coast of Ionia, later lived in Croton in southern Italy (Magna Graecia)Pythagoreans hold that ""all is number"", giving formal accounts in contrast to the previous material of the IoniansThe discovery of consonant intervals in music by the group enabled the concept of harmony to be established in philosophy, which suggested that opposites could together give rise to new things",4
"They also believed in metempsychosis, the transmigration of souls, or reincarnationParmenides argued that, unlike the other philosophers who believed the arche was transformed into multiple things, the world must be singular, unchanging and eternal, while anything suggesting the contrary was an illusionZeno of Elea formulated his famous paradoxes in order to support the Parmenides' views about the illusion of plurality and change (in terms of motion), by demonstrating them to be impossible",4
"An alternative explanation was presented by Heraclitus, who claimed that everything was in flux all the time, famously pointing out that one could not step into the same river twiceEmpedocles may have been an associate of both Parmenides and the PythagoreansHe claimed the arche was in fact composed of multiple sources, giving rise to the model of the four classical elementsThese in turn were acted upon by the forces of Love and Strife, creating the mixtures of elements which form the world",4
"Another view of the arche being acted upon by an external force was presented by his older contemporary Anaxagoras, who claimed that nous, the mind, was responsible for thatLeucippus and Democritus proposed atomism as an explanation for the fundamental nature of the universeJonathan Barnes called atomism ""the culmination of early Greek thought"".In addition to these philosophers, the Sophists comprised teachers of rhetoric who taught students to debate on any side of an issue",4
"While as a group, they held no specific views, in general they promoted subjectivism and relativismProtagoras, one of the most influential Sophist philosophers, claimed that ""man is the measure of all things"", suggesting there is no objective truthThis was also applied to issues of ethics, with Prodicus arguing that laws could not be taken seriously because they changed all the time, while Antiphon made the claim that conventional morality should only be followed when in society",4
"     Classical period    The Classical period of ancient Greek philosophy centers on Socrates and the two generations of students following himSocrates experienced a life-changing event when his friend, Chaerephon visited the Oracle of Delphi where the Pythia told him that no one in Athens was wiser than SocratesLearning of this, Socrates subsequently spent much of his life questioning anyone in Athens who would engage him, in order to investigate the Pithia's claim",4
"Socrates developed a critical approach, now called the Socratic method, to examine people's viewsHe focused on issues of human life: eudaimonia, justice, beauty, truth, and virtueAlthough Socrates wrote nothing himself, two of his disciples, Plato and Xenophon, wrote about some of his conversations, although Plato also deployed Socrates as a fictional character in some of his dialoguesThese Socratic dialogues display the Socratic method being applied to examine philosophical problems",4
"Socrates's questioning earned him enemies who eventually accused him of impiety and corrupting the youthThe Athenian democracy tried him, was found guilty, and was sentenced to deathAlthough his friends offered to help him escape from prison, Socrates chose to remain in Athens and abide by his principlesHis execution consisted of drinking poison hemlockHe died in 399 BCEAfter Socrates' death, Plato founded the Platonic Academy and Platonic philosophy",4
"As Socrates had done, Plato identified virtue with knowledgeThis led him to questions of epistemology on what knowledge is and how it is acquired.Socrates had several other students who also founded schools of philosophyTwo of these were short-lived: the Eretrian school, founded by Phaedo of Elis, and the Megarian school, founded by Euclid of MegaraTwo others were long-lasting: Cynicism, founded by Antisthenes, and Cyrenaicism, founded by AristippusThe Cynics considered life's purpose to live in virtue, in agreement with nature, rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, and fame, leading a simple life free from all possessions",4
"The Cyrenaics promoted a philosophy nearly opposite that of the Cynics, endorsing hedonism, holding that pleasure was the supreme good, especially immediate gratifications; and that people could only know their own experiences, beyond that truth was unknowable The final school of philosophy to be established during the Classical period was the Peripatetic school, founded by Plato's student, AristotleAristotle wrote widely about topics of philosophical concern, including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, politics, and logic",4
"Aristotelian logic was the first type of logic to attempt to categorize every valid syllogismHis epistemology comprised an early form empiricismAristotle criticized Plato's metaphysics as being poetic metaphor, with its greatest failing being the lack of an explanation for changeAristotle proposed the four causes model to explain change - material, efficient, formal, and final - all of which were grounded on what Aristotle termed the unmoved moverHis ethical views identified eudaimonia as the ultimate good, as it was good in itself",4
"He thought that eudaimonia could be achieved by living according to human nature, which is to live with reason and virtue, defining virtue as the golden mean between extremesAristotle saw politics as the highest art, as all other pursuits are subservient to its goal of improving societyThe state should aim to maximize the opportunities for the pursuit of reason and virtue through leisure, learning, and contemplationAristotle tutored Alexander the Great, who conquered much of the ancient Western world",4
"Hellenization and Aristotelian philosophy have exercised considerable influence on almost all subsequent Western and Middle Eastern philosophers     Hellenistic and Roman philosophy     The Hellenistic and Roman Imperial periods saw the continuation of Aristotelianism and Cynicism, and the emergence of new philosophies, including Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, Stoicism, and NeopythagoreanismPlatonism also continued but came under new interpretations, particularly Academic skepticism in the Hellenistic period and Neoplatonism in the Imperial periodThe traditions of Greek philosophy heavily influenced Roman philosophy",4
"In Imperial times, Epicureanism and Stoicism were particularly popularThe various schools of philosophy proposed various and conflicting methods for attaining eudaimoniaFor some schools, it was through internal means, such as calmness, ataraxia (ἀταραξία), or indifference, apatheia (ἀπάθεια), which was possibly caused by the increased insecurity of the eraThe aim of the Cynics was to live according to nature and against convention with courage and self-controlThis was directly inspiring to the founder of Stoicism, Zeno of Citium, who took up the Cynic ideals of steadfastness and self-discipline, but applied the concept of apatheia to personal circumstances rather than social norms, and switched shameless flouting of the latter for a resolute fulfillment of social duties",4
"The ideal of 'living in accordance with nature' also continued, with this being seen as the way to eudaimonia, which in this case was identified as the freedom from fears and desires and required choosing how to respond to external circumstances, as the quality of life was seen as based on one's beliefs about itAn alternative view was presented by the Cyrenaics and the EpicureansThe Cyrenaics were hedonists and believed that pleasure was the supreme good in life, especially physical pleasure, which they thought more intense and more desirable than mental pleasures",4
"The followers of Epicurus also identified ""the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain"" as the ultimate goal of life, but noted that ""We do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or of sensuality we mean the absence of pain in the body and trouble in the mind""This brought hedonism back to the search for ataraxia.Another important strand of thought in post-Classical Western thought was the question of skepticism",4
"Pyrrho of Elis, a Democritean philosopher, traveled to India with Alexander the Great's army where Pyrrho was influenced by Buddhist teachings, most particularly the three marks of existenceAfter returning to Greece, Pyrrho started a new school of philosophy, Pyrrhonism, which taught that it is one's opinions about non-evident matters (i.e., dogma) that prevent one from attaining ataraxiaTo bring the mind to ataraxia, Pyrrhonism uses epoché (suspension of judgment) regarding all non-evident propositions",4
"After Arcesilaus became head of the Academy, he adopted skepticism as a central tenet of Platonism, making Platonism nearly the same as PyrrhonismAfter Arcesilaus, Academic skepticism diverged from PyrrhonismThe Academic skeptics did not doubt the existence of truth; they just doubted that humans had the capacities for obtaining itThey based this position on Plato's Phaedo, sections 64–67, in which Socrates discusses how knowledge is not accessible to mortals.Following the end of the skeptical period of the Academy with Antiochus of Ascalon, Platonic thought entered the period of Middle Platonism, which absorbed ideas from the Peripatetic and Stoic schools",4
"More extreme syncretism was done by Numenius of Apamea, who combined it with NeopythagoreanismAlso affected by the Neopythagoreans, the Neoplatonists, first of them Plotinus, argued that mind exists before matter, and that the universe has a singular cause which must therefore be a single mindAs such, Neoplatonism become essentially a religion, and had much impact on later Christian thought    Medieval    Medieval philosophy roughly extends from the Christianization of the Roman Empire until the Renaissance",4
"It is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical Greek and Hellenistic philosophy, and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then-widespread sacred doctrines of Abrahamic religion (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) with secular learningSome problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of faith to reason, the existence and unity of God, the object of theology and metaphysics, the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation",4
"A prominent figure of this period was Augustine of Hippo, one of the most important Church Fathers in Western ChristianityAugustine adopted Plato's thought and Christianized itHis influence dominated medieval philosophy perhaps up to the end of era and the rediscovery of Aristotle's textsAugustinianism was the preferred starting point for most philosophers up until the 13th centuryAmong the issues his philosophy touched upon were the problem of evil, just war and what time is",4
"On the problem of evil, he argued that evil was a necessary product of human free willWhen this raised the issue of the incompatibility of free will and divine foreknowledge, both he and Boethius solved the issue by arguing that God did not see the future, but rather stood outside of time entirely.An influential school of thought was that of scholasticism, which is not so much a philosophy or a theology as a methodology, as it places a strong emphasis on dialectical reasoning to extend knowledge by inference and to resolve contradictions",4
"Scholastic thought is also known for rigorous conceptual analysis and the careful drawing of distinctionsIn the classroom and in writing, it often takes the form of explicit disputation; a topic drawn from the tradition is broached in the form of a question, oppositional responses are given, a counterproposal is argued and oppositional arguments rebuttedBecause of its emphasis on rigorous dialectical method, scholasticism was eventually applied to many other fields of study",4
"Anselm of Canterbury (called the 'father of scholasticism') argued that the existence of God could be irrefutably proved with the logical conclusion apparent in the ontological argument, according to which God is by definition the greatest thing in conceivable, and since an existing thing is greater than a non-existing one, it must be that God exists or is not the greatest thing conceivable (the latter being by definition impossible)A refutation of this was offered by Gaunilo of Marmoutiers, who applied the same logic to an imagined island, arguing that somewhere there must exist a perfect island using the same steps of reasoning (therefore leading to an absurd outcome).Boethius also worked on the problem of universals, arguing that they did not exist independently as claimed by Plato, but still believed, in line with Aristotle, that they existed in the substance of particular things",4
"Another important figure for scholasticism, Peter Abelard, extended this to nominalism, which states (in complete opposition to Plato) that universals were in fact just names given to characteristics shared by particulars.Thomas Aquinas, an academic philosopher and the father of Thomism, was immensely influential in medieval ChristendomHe was influenced by newly discovered Aristotle, and aimed to reconcile his philosophy with Christian theologyAiming to develop an understanding of the soul, he was led to consider metaphysical questions of substance, matter, form, and change",4
"He defined a material substance as the combination of an essence and accidental features, with the essence being a combination of matter and form, similar to the Aristotelian viewFor humans, the soul is the essenceAlso influenced by Plato, he saw the soul as unchangeable and independent of the body.Other Western philosophers from the Middle Ages include John Scotus Eriugena, Gilbert de la Porrée, Peter Lombard, Hildegard of Bingen, Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Bonaventure, Peter John Olivi, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Robert Kilwardby, Albertus Magnus, Henry of Ghent, Duns Scotus, Marguerite Porete, Dante Alighieri, Marsilius of Padua, William of Ockham, Jean Buridan, Nicholas of Autrecourt, Meister Eckhart, Catherine of Siena, Jean Gerson, and John Wycliffe",4
"The medieval tradition of scholasticism continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, in figures such as Francisco Suárez and John of StThomasDuring the Middle Ages, Western philosophy was also influenced by the Jewish philosophers Maimonides and Gersonides; and the Muslim philosophers Alkindus, Alfarabi, Alhazen, Avicenna, Algazel, Avempace, Abubacer, Ibn Khaldūn, and Averroes    Renaissance    The Renaissance (""rebirth"") was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought, in which the recovery of ancient Greek philosophical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics, and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology, and mysticism",4
"The study of the classics and the humane arts generally, such as history and literature, enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in Christendom, a tendency referred to as humanismDisplacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic, the humanists followed Petrarch in making humanity and its virtues the focus of philosophy.At the point of passage from Renaissance into early/classical modern philosophy, the dialogue was used as a primary style of writing by Renaissance philosophers, such as Giordano Bruno.The dividing line between what is classified as Renaissance versus modern philosophy is disputed",4
"    Modern    The term ""modern philosophy"" has multiple usagesFor example, Thomas Hobbes is sometimes considered the first modern philosopher because he applied a systematic method to political philosophyBy contrast, René Descartes is often considered the first modern philosopher because he grounded his philosophy in problems of knowledge, rather than problems of metaphysics Modern philosophy and especially Enlightenment philosophy is distinguished by its increasing independence from traditional authorities such as the Church, academia, and Aristotelianism; a new focus on the foundations of knowledge and metaphysical system-building; and the emergence of modern physics out of natural philosophy",4
"     Early modern (17th and 18th centuries)     Some central topics of Western philosophy in its early modern (also classical modern) period include the nature of the mind and its relation to the body, the implications of the new natural sciences for traditional theological topics such as free will and God, and the emergence of a secular basis for moral and political philosophyThese trends first distinctively coalesce in Francis Bacon's call for a new, empirical program for expanding knowledge, and soon found massively influential form in the mechanical physics and rationalist metaphysics of René Descartes.Descartes' epistemology was based on a method called Cartesian doubt, whereby only the most certain belief could act as the foundation for further inquiry, with each step to further ideas being as cautious and clear as possible",4
"This led him to his famous maxim cogito ergo sum ('I think, therefore I exist'), though similar arguments had been made by earlier philosophersThis became foundational for much of further Western philosophy, as the need to find a route from the private world of consciousness to the externally existing reality was widely accepted until the 20th centuryA major issue for his thought remained in the mind–body problem, howeverOne solution to the problem was presented by Baruch Spinoza, who argued that the mind and the body are one substance",4
"This was based on his view that God and the universe are one and the same, encompassing the totality of existenceIn the other extreme, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, argued instead that the world was composed of numerous individual substances, called monadsTogether, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz are considered influential early rationalists.In contrast to Descartes, Thomas Hobbes was a materialist who believed that everything was physical, and an empiricist who thought that all knowledge comes from sensation which is triggered by objects existing in the external world, with thought being a kind of computation",4
"John Locke was another classic empiricist, with his arguments helping it overtake rationalism as the generally preferred approachTogether with David Hume, they form the core of 'British empiricism'George Berkeley agreed with empiricism, but instead of believing in an ultimate reality which created perceptions, argued in favour immaterialism and the world existing as a result of being perceivedIn contrast, the Cambridge Platonists continued to represent rationalism in Britain.In terms of political philosophy, arguments often started from arguing over the first principles of human nature through the thought experiment of what the world would look like without society, a scenario referred to as the state of nature",4
"Hobbes believed that this would be a violent and anarchic, calling life under such a state of affairs ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short""To prevent this, he believed that the sovereign of the state should have essentially unlimited powerIn contrast, Locke believed the state of nature be one where individuals enjoyed freedom, but that some of that (excluding those covered by natural rights) had to be given up when forming a society, but not to the degree of absolute rule",4
"Jean-Jacques Rousseau meanwhile argued that in nature people were living in a peaceful and comfortable state, and that the formation of society led to the rise of inequality.The approximate end of the early modern period is most often identified with Immanuel Kant's systematic attempt to limit metaphysics, justify scientific knowledge, and reconcile both of these with morality and freedomWhereas the rationalists had believed that knowledge came from a priori reasoning, the empiricists had argued that it came from a posteriori sensory experience, Kant aimed to reconcile these views by arguing that the mind uses a priori understanding to interpret the a posteriori experiences",4
"He had been inspired to take this approach by the philosophy of Hume, who argued that the mechanisms of the mind gave people the perception of cause and effect.Many other contributors were philosophers, scientists, medical doctors, and politiciansA short list includes Galileo Galilei, Pierre Gassendi, Blaise Pascal, Nicolas Malebranche, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Christiaan Huygens, Isaac Newton, Christian Wolff, Montesquieu, Pierre Bayle, Thomas Reid, Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Adam Smith     Late modern (19th century)     Late modern philosophy is usually considered to begin around the pivotal year of 1781, when Gotthold Ephraim Lessing died and Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason appeared",4
"The 19th century saw the beginnings of what would later grow into the divide between Continental and analytic traditions of philosophy, with the former more interested in general frameworks of metaphysics (more common in the German-speaking world), and the latter focusing on issues of epistemology, ethics, law and politics (more common in the English-speaking world).German philosophy exercised broad influence in this century, owing in part to the dominance of the German university system",4
"German idealists, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and the members of Jena Romanticism (Friedrich Hölderlin, Novalis, and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel), transformed the work of Kant by maintaining that the world is constituted by a rational or mind-like process, and as such is entirely knowableHegel argued that history was the dialectical journey of the Geist (universal mind) towards self-fulfilment and self-realizationThe Geist's self-awareness is absolute knowledge, which itself brings complete freedom",4
" His philosophy was based on absolute idealism, with reality itself being mental His legacy was divided between the conservative Right Hegelians and radical Young Hegelians, with the latter including David Strauss and Ludwig FeuerbachFeuerbach argued for a materialist conception of Hegel's thought, inspiring Karl Marx.Arthur Schopenhauer was inspired by Kant and Indian philosophyAccepting Kant's division of the world into the noumenal (the real) and phenomenal (the apparent) realities, he nevertheless disagreed on the accessibility of former, arguing that it could in fact be accessed",4
"The experience of will was how this reality was accessible, with the will underlying the whole of nature, with everything else being appearanceWhereas he believed the frustration of this will was the cause of suffering,  Friedrich Nietzsche thought that the will to power was empowering, leading to growth and expansion, and therefore forming the basis of ethicsJeremy Bentham established utilitarianism, which was a consequentialist ethic based on 'the greatest happiness for the greatest number', an idea taken from Cesare Beccaria",4
"He believed that any act could be measured by its value in this regard through the application of felicific calculusHis associate James Mill's son John Stuart Mill subsequently took up his thoughtHowever, in contrast to the valuation of pure pleasure in Bentham's work, Mill divided pleasures into higher and lower kinds.Logic began a period of its most significant advances since the inception of the discipline, as increasing mathematical precision opened entire fields of inference to formalization in the work of George Boole and Gottlob Frege",4
"Other philosophers who initiated lines of thought that would continue to shape philosophy into the 20th century include:  Gottlob Frege and Henry Sidgwick, whose work in logic and ethics, respectively, provided the tools for early analytic philosophyCharles Sanders Peirce and William James, who founded pragmatismSøren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, who laid the groundwork for existentialism and post-structuralism    Contemporary (20th and 21st centuries)    The three major contemporary approaches to academic philosophy are analytic philosophy, continental philosophy and pragmatism",4
"They are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusiveThe 20th century deals with the upheavals produced by a series of conflicts within philosophical discourse over the basis of knowledge, with classical certainties overthrown, and new social, economic, scientific and logical problems20th-century philosophy was set for a series of attempts to reform and preserve and to alter or abolish, older knowledge systemsSeminal figures include Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Jean-Paul Sartre",4
"The publication of Husserl's Logical Investigations (1900–1) and Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903) is considered to mark the beginning of 20th-century philosophyThe 20th century also saw the increasing professionalization of the discipline and the beginning of the current (contemporary) era of philosophy.Since the Second World War, contemporary philosophy has been divided mostly into analytic and continental traditions; the former carried in the English speaking world and the latter on the continent of Europe",4
"The perceived conflict between continental and analytic schools of philosophy remains prominent, despite increasing skepticism regarding the distinction's usefulness     Analytic philosophy     In the English-speaking world, analytic philosophy became the dominant school for much of the 20th centuryThe term ""analytic philosophy"" roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation, attention to semantics, use of classical logic and non-classical logic and clarity of meaning above all other criteriaThough the movement has broadened, it was a cohesive school in the first half of the century",4
"Analytic philosophers were shaped strongly by logical positivism, united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to logic and language     Logic     Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884) was the first analytic work, according to Michael Dummett (Origins of Analytical Philosophy, 1993)Frege was the first to take 'the linguistic turn,' analyzing philosophical problems through languageHe invented a formal notational system for logicHis stance was one of anti-psychologism, arguing that logical truths were independent of the human minds discovering them.Bertrand Russell and G",4
"EMoore are also often counted as founders of analytic philosophyThey believed that philosophy should be based on analysing propositionsRussell wrote Principia Mathematica (with Alfred North Whitehead)  to apply this to mathematics, while Moore did the same for ethics with Principia EthicaRussell's attempts to find a foundation for mathematics led him to Russell's paradox, which caused Frege to abandon logicismRussell espoused logical atomism, declaring that ""logic is the essence of philosophy""",4
"In his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Ludwig Wittgenstein put forward a refined version of this viewWittgenstein, Russell's 'disciple', argued that the problems of philosophy were simply products of language which were actually meaninglessThis was based on the picture theory of meaningWittgenstein later changed his conception of how language works, arguing instead that it has many different uses, which he called different language games     Philosophy of science    The logical positivists of the Vienna Circle started as a study group of Russell and Whitehead",4
"They argued that the arguments of metaphysics, ethics and theology were meaningless, as they were not logically or empirically verifiableThis was based on their division of meaningful statements into either the analytic (logical and mathematical statements) and the synthetic (scientific claims)Moritz Schlick and Rudolf Carnap argued that science rested at its roots on direct observation, but Otto Neurath noted that observation already requires theory in order to have meaningAnother participant in the Circle was Carnap's self-confessed disciple, Willard Van Orman Quine",4
"In 'Two Dogmas of Empiricism', Quine criticized the distinction between analytic and synthetic statementsInstead, he advocated for a 'web of belief' approach, whereby all beliefs come from contact with reality (including mathematical ones), but with some being further removed from this contact than others.Another former participant in the Circle was Karl PopperHe argued that verificationism was logically incoherent, promoting instead falsificationism as the basis for scienceA further advancement in the philosophy of science was made by Imre Lakatos, who argued that negative findings in individual tests did not falsify theories, but rather entire research programmes would eventually fail explain phenomena",4
"Thomas Kuhn further argued that science was composed of paradigms, which would eventually shift when evidence accumulated against themBased on the idea that different paradigms had different meanings of expressions, Paul Feyerabend went further in arguing for relativism in science     Philosophy of language    Wittgenstein had first brought up the idea that ordinary language could solve philosophical problemsA loosely associated group of philosophers later became known as practitioners of ordinary language philosophy",4
"It included Gilbert Ryle, JLAustin, RMHare, and PFStrawsonThey believed that as philosophy was not science, it could only be advanced through careful conceptual clarification and connection instead of observation and experimentationHowever, they had given up the earlier analytic pursuit of using formal logic to express an ideal language, but did nevertheless share the scepticism of metaphysical grand theoriesUnlike Wittgenstein, they believed only some problems of philosophy to be artifacts of language",4
"This approach has been described as the linguistic turn of analytic philosophyRyle introduced the concept of category mistake, which described the misapplication of a concept in the wrong context (which he accused Descartes of doing with the ghost in the machine)One of Austin's key insights was that some language perform a perlocutionary function (creating by themselves an effect on the world), thereby being speech actsThis idea was later taken up by John Searle.In the final third of the 20th century, philosophy of language emerged as its own programme",4
"The theory of meaning became central to this programmeDonald Davidson argued that meaning could be understood through a theory of truthThis was based on the work of Alfred TarskiEmpirically, Davidson would find the meaning of words in different languages by linking them with the objective conditions of their utterance, which established their truthnessMeaning therefore emerges from the consensus of interpretations of speaker behaviourMichael Dummett argued against this view on the basis of its realism",4
"This was because realism would make the truthness of many sentences beyond measurabilityInstead, he argued for verifiability, based on the idea that one could recognise the proof of truth when offered itAlternative to these, Paul Grice put forward a theory that meaning was based on the intention of the speaker, which over time becomes established after repeated use.Theories of reference were another major strand of thought on languageFrege had argued that proper names were linked to its referent through a description of what the name refers to",4
"Russell agreed with this, adding that ""this"" can replace a description in cases of familiarityLater, Searle and Strawson expanded these ideas by noting that a cluster of descriptions, each of them usable, may be used by linguistic communitiesKeith Donnellan further argued that sometimes a description could be wrong but still make the correct reference, this being different from the attributive use of a descriptionHe, as well as Saul Kripke and Hilary Putnam independently, argued that often the referents of proper names are not based on description, but rather on a history of usage passing through users",4
"Towards the end of the century, philosophy of language began to diverge in two directions: the philosophy of mind, and more specific study of particular aspects of language, the latter supported by linguistics     Philosophy of mind    Early identity theories of mind in the 1950s and '60s were based on the work of Ullin Place, Herbert Feigl, and JJCSmartWhile earlier philosophers such as the Logical Positivists, Quine, Wittgenstein, and Ryle had all used some form of behaviorism to dispense with the mental, they believed that behaviorism was insufficient in explaining many aspects of mental phenomena",4
"Feigl argued that intentional states could not be thus explainedInstead, he espoused externalismPlace meanwhile argued that the mind could be reduced to physical events, while Feigl and Sense agreed they were identicalFunctionalism in contrast argued that the mind was defined by what it does, rather than what it is based onTo argue against this, John Searle developed the Chinese room thought experimentDavidson argued for anomalous monism, which claims that while mental events cause physical ones, and the all causal relations are governed by natural laws, there are however no natural laws governing the causality between mental and physical events",4
"This anomaly in the name was explained by supervenience.In 1970, Keith Campbell proposed a ""new epiphenomenalism"", according to which the body produces the mind that does not act on the body, a process which he claims is destined to remain mysteriousPaul Churchland and Patricia Churchland argued for eliminative materialism, which claims that understanding the brain will lead to a complete understanding of the mindThis was based on developments in neuroscience",4
"However, physicalist theories of mind have had to grapple with the issue of subjective experience raised by Thomas Nagel in What Is It Like to Be a Bat? and Frank Cameron Jackson's so-called knowledge argumentDavid Chalmers also argued against physicalism in the philosophical zombie argumentHe further noted that subjective experience posed the hard problem of consciousnessThe inability of physicalist theories to explain conscious feeling has been termed the explanatory gap",4
"In contrast, Daniel Dennett has claimed that no such gap exists as subjective experiences are a 'philosophical fiction'     Ethics    Ethics in 20th century analytic philosophy has been argued to have began with Moore's Principia EthicaMoore argued that what is good cannot be definedInstead, he saw ethical behaviour a result of intuition, which led to non-cognitivismWDRoss in contrast argued that duty formed the basis for ethics.Russell's meta-ethical thought anticipated emotivism and error theory",4
"This was supported by the logical positivists, and later popularised by AJAyerCharles Stevenson also argued that ethical terms were expressions of emotive meanings by speakers RMHare aimed to expand their meaning from mere expressions, to also being prescriptions which are universalizableJLMackie supported error theory on the basis that objective values do not exist, as they are culturally relative and would be metaphysically strange.Another strand of ethical thinking began with G",4
"EMAnscombe arguing in 1958 that both consequentialism and deontology were based on obligation, which could not function without divine authority, instead promoting virtue ethicsOther notable virtue ethicists included Philippa Foot and Alasdair MacIntyreThe latter combined it with communitarianism     Other branches     Notable students of Quine include Donald Davidson and Daniel DennettThe later work of Russell and the philosophy of Willard Van Orman Quine are influential exemplars of the naturalist approach dominant in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century",4
"But the diversity of analytic philosophy from the 1970s onward defies easy generalization: the naturalism of Quine and his epigoni was in some precincts superseded by a ""new metaphysics"" of possible worlds, as in the influential work of David LewisRecently, the experimental philosophy movement has sought to reappraise philosophical problems through social science research techniquesSome influential figures in contemporary analytic philosophy are: Timothy Williamson, David Lewis, John Searle, Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Michael Dummett, John McDowell, Saul Kripke, Peter van Inwagen, and Patricia Churchland",4
"Analytic philosophy has sometimes been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aestheticsHowever, with the appearance of A Theory of Justice by John Rawls and Anarchy, State, and Utopia by Robert Nozick, analytic political philosophy acquired respectabilityAnalytic philosophers have also shown depth in their investigations of aesthetics, with Roger Scruton, Nelson Goodman, Arthur Danto and others developing the subject to its current shape     Continental philosophy     Continental philosophy is a set of 19th- and 20th-century philosophical traditions from mainland Europe",4
"20th-century movements such as German idealism, phenomenology, existentialism, modern hermeneutics (the theory and methodology of interpretation), critical theory, structuralism, post-structuralism and others are included within this loose categoryWhile identifying any non-trivial common factor in all these schools of thought is bound to be controversial, Michael ERosen has hypothesized a few common continental themes: that the natural sciences cannot replace the human sciences; that the thinker is affected by the conditions of experience (one's place and time in history); that philosophy is both theoretical and practical; that metaphilosophy or reflection upon the methods and nature of philosophy itself is an important part of philosophy proper.The founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl, sought to study consciousness as experienced from a first-person perspective, while Martin Heidegger drew on the ideas of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Husserl to propose an unconventional existential approach to ontology",4
"Phenomenologically oriented metaphysics undergirded existentialism—Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Albert Camus—and finally post-structuralism—Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard (best known for his articulation of postmodernism), Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida (best known for developing a form of semiotic analysis known as deconstruction)The psychoanalytic work of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, and others has also been influential in contemporary continental thoughtConversely, some philosophers have attempted to define and rehabilitate older traditions of philosophy",4
"Most notably, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Alasdair MacIntyre have both, albeit in different ways, revived the tradition of Aristotelianism     Existentialism     Existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of late 19th- and 20th-century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences, shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individualIn existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called ""the existential attitude"", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world",4
"Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.Although they did not use the term, the 19th-century philosophers Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialismTheir influence, however, has extended beyond existentialist thought     German idealism     German idealism emerged in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuriesIt developed out of the work of Immanuel Kant in the 1780s and 1790s.Transcendental idealism, advocated by Immanuel Kant, is the view that there are limits on what can be understood since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment",4
"Kant wrote his Critique of Pure Reason (1781) in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism, and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysicsAlthough Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a conceptual or categorical framework on the stream of pure sensory data—a framework including space and time themselves—he maintained that things-in-themselves existed independently of human perceptions and judgments; he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense",4
"Kant's account of things-in-themselves is both controversial and highly complexContinuing his work, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world, and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophyThe most notable work of absolute idealism was GWFHegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, of 1807Hegel admitted his ideas were not new, but that all the previous philosophies had been incompleteHis goal was to correctly finish their job",4
"Hegel asserts that the twin aims of philosophy are to account for the contradictions apparent in human experience (which arise, for instance, out of the supposed contradictions between ""being"" and ""not being""), and also simultaneously to resolve and preserve these contradictions by showing their compatibility at a higher level of examination (""being"" and ""not being"" are resolved with ""becoming"")This program of acceptance and reconciliation of contradictions is known as the ""Hegelian dialectic""",4
"Philosophers influenced by Hegel include Ludwig Feuerbach, who coined the term ""projection"" as pertaining to humans' inability to recognize anything in the external world without projecting qualities of ourselves upon those things; Karl Marx; Friedrich Engels; and the British idealists, notably THGreen, JMEMcTaggart, FHBradley, and RGCollingwoodFew 20th-century philosophers embraced the core tenets of German idealism after the demise of British idealismHowever, quite a few have embraced Hegelian dialectic, most notably Frankfurt School critical theorists, Alexandre Kojève, Jean-Paul Sartre (in his Critique of Dialectical Reason), and Slavoj Žižek",4
"A central theme of German idealism, the legitimacy of Kant's ""Copernican revolution"", remains an important point of contention in 21st-century post-continental philosophy     Marxism and critical theory     Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis, originating from Karl Marx and Friedrich EngelsIt analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformationMarxist analyses and methodologies influenced political ideologies and social movementsMarxist understandings of history and society were adopted by academics in archeology, anthropology, media studies, political science, theater, history, sociology, art history and theory, cultural studies, education, economics, geography, literary criticism, aesthetics, critical psychology and philosophy",4
"In contemporary philosophy, the term ""critical theory"" describes the Western Marxist philosophy of the Frankfurt School, which was developed in Germany in the 1930sCritical theory maintains that ideology is the principal obstacle to human emancipation     Phenomenology and hermeneutics     Edmund Husserl's phenomenology was an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for an account of the structure of conscious experience in generalAn important part of Husserl's phenomenological project was to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content, a feature that Husserl called intentionality",4
"Husserl published only a few works in his lifetime, which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms; but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analysesHusserl's work was immediately influential in Germany, with the foundation of phenomenological schools in Munich (Munich phenomenology) and Göttingen (Göttingen phenomenology)Phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as Martin Heidegger (formerly Husserl's research assistant and a proponent of hermeneutic phenomenology, a theoretical synthesis of modern hermeneutics and phenomenology), Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre",4
"Through the work of Heidegger and Sartre, Husserl's focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of existentialism     Structuralism and post-structuralism     Inaugurated by the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, structuralism sought to clarify systems of signs through analyzing the discourses they both limit and make possibleSaussure conceived of the sign as being delimited by all the other signs in the system, and ideas as being incapable of existence prior to linguistic structure, which articulates thought",4
"This led continental thought away from humanism, and toward what was termed the decentering of man: language is no longer spoken by man to express a true inner self, but language speaks manStructuralism sought the province of a hard science, but its positivism soon came under fire by post-structuralism, a wide field of thinkers, some of whom were once themselves structuralists, but later came to criticize itStructuralists believed they could analyze systems from an external, objective standing, for example, but the poststructuralists argued that this is incorrect, that one cannot transcend structures and thus analysis is itself determined by what it examines",4
"While the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated as crystalline by structuralists, poststructuralists asserted that every attempt to grasp the signified results in more signifiers, so meaning is always in a state of being deferred, making an ultimate interpretation impossibleStructuralism came to dominate continental philosophy throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, encompassing thinkers as diverse as Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes and Jacques LacanPost-structuralism came to predominate from the 1970s onwards, including thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and even Roland Barthes; it incorporated a critique of structuralism's limitations",4
"     Pragmatism     Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that began in the United States around 1870It asserts that the truth of beliefs consists in their usefulness and efficacy rather than their correspondence with realityCharles Sanders Peirce and William James were its co-founders and it was later modified by John Dewey as instrumentalismSince the usefulness of any belief at any time might be contingent on circumstance, Peirce and James conceptualized final truth as something established only by the future, final settlement of all opinion",4
" Pragmatism attempted to find a scientific concept of truth that does not depend on personal insight (revelation) or reference to some metaphysical realmIt interpreted the meaning of a statement by the effect its acceptance would have on practiceInquiry taken far enough is thus the only path to truth.For Peirce commitment to inquiry was essential to truth-finding, implied by the idea and hope that inquiry is not fruitlessThe interpretation of these principles has been subject to discussion ever since",4
"Peirce's maxim of pragmatism is, ""Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to haveThen, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.""Critics accused pragmatism falling victim to a simple fallacy: that because something that is true proves useful, that usefulness is an appropriate basis for its truthfulnessPragmatist thinkers include Dewey, George Santayana, and CI",4
"LewisPragmatism was later worked on by neopragmatists Richard Rorty who was the first to develop neopragmatist philosophy in his Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1979), Hilary Putnam, WVOQuine, and Donald DavidsonNeopragmatism has been described as a bridge between analytic and continental philosophy     Process philosophy     Process philosophy is a tradition beginning with Alfred North Whitehead, who began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined Harvard University in 1924",4
"This tradition identifies metaphysical reality with changeProcess philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to continental philosophy than analytic philosophy, because it is usually only taught in continental departmentsHowever, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus continental methods in contemporary philosophy    Influence by non-Western philosophy       Eastern philosophy        Pyrrhonism     The Ancient Greek philosopher Pyrrho accompanied Alexander the Great in his eastern campaigns, spending about 18 months in India",4
"Pyrrho subsequently returned to Greece and founded Pyrrhonism, a philosophy with substantial similarities with BuddhismThe Greek biographer Diogenes Laërtius explained that Pyrrho's equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in IndiaPyrrho was directly influenced by Buddhism in developing his philosophy, which is based on Pyrrho's interpretation of the Buddhist three marks of existenceAccording to Edward Conze, Pyrrhonism can be compared to Buddhist philosophy, especially the Indian Madhyamika school",4
"The Pyrrhonists' goal of ataraxia (the state of being untroubled) is a soteriological goal similar to nirvanaThe Pyrrhonists promoted suspending judgment (epoché) about dogma (beliefs about non-evident matters) as the way to reach ataraxiaThis is similar to the Buddha's refusal to answer certain metaphysical questions which he saw as non-conductive to the path of Buddhist practice and Nagarjuna's ""relinquishing of all views (drsti)""Adrian Kuzminski argues for direct influence between these two systems of thought",4
"In Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism According to Kuzminski, both philosophies argue against assenting to any dogmatic assertions about an ultimate metaphysical reality behind our sense impressions as a tactic to reach tranquility and both also make use of logical arguments against other philosophies in order to expose their contradictions     Cyrenaicism    The Cyrenaic philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene is thought by some to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries",4
"     Spinozism    Similarities between Spinozism and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authoritiesThe 19th-century German Sanskritist Theodore Goldstücker was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the Vedanta tradition of IndiaIt has also been said that Spinozism is similar to the Hindu doctrines of Samkhya and YogaThough within the various existing Indian traditions there exist many traditions which astonishingly had such similar doctrines from ages, out of which most similar and well known are the Kashmiri Shaivism and Nath tradition, apart from already existing Samkhya and Yoga",4
"     No-self theory    Empiricist philosophers, such as Hume and Berkeley, favoured the bundle theory of personal identityIn this theory, the mind is simply 'a bundle of perceptions' without unityOne interpretation of Hume's view of the self, argued for by philosopher and psychologist James Giles, is that Hume is not arguing for a bundle theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative view of the selfRather than reducing the self to a bundle of perceptions, Hume rejects the idea of the self altogether",4
"On this interpretation, Hume is proposing a ""no-self theory"" and thus has much in common with Buddhist thought (see anattā)Psychologist Alison Gopnik has argued that Hume was in a position to learn about Buddhist thought during his time in France in the 1730s    See also    African philosophy Christian philosophy Eastern philosophy Glossary of philosophy History of metaphysical realism History of metaphysical naturalism History of philosophy Index of philosophy Islamic philosophy Jewish philosophy List of philosophers List of philosophical theories List of philosophies PseudophilosophyNational traditionsAmerican philosophy British philosophy French philosophy German philosophy (including Austrian philosophy) Polish philosophyNon-mainstream movementsNew realism Objectivism Personalism Post-analytic philosophy Post-Continental philosophy Theosophy (Theosophy and Western philosophy)     References       Sources   Annas, Julia (1995), The Morality of Happiness, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-509652-5 Reale, Giovanni; Catan, John R",4

"Philosophy (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, 'love of wisdom') is the study of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and languageSuch questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolvedSome sources claim the term was coined by Pythagoras (c570 – c495 BCE); others dispute this story, arguing that Pythagoreans merely claimed use of a preexisting term Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher",4
"From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, ""natural philosophy"" encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physicsFor example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physicsIn the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specializeSince then, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, and namely the social sciences such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics",4
"Today, major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics, which is concerned with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; epistemology, which studies the nature of knowledge and belief; ethics, which is concerned with moral value; and logic, which studies the rules of inference that allow one to derive conclusions from true premisesOther notable subfields include philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind    Definitions   Initially, the term referred to any body of knowledge",4
"In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education, and politics.In section thirteen of his Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers, the oldest surviving history of philosophy (3rd century), Diogenes Laërtius presents a three-part division of ancient Greek philosophical inquiry: Natural philosophy (i.ephysics, from Greek: ta physika, lit. 'things having to do with physis [nature]') was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world",4
"Moral philosophy (i.eethics, from êthika, 'having to do with character, disposition, manners') was the study of goodness, right and wrong, justice and virtueMetaphysical philosophy (i.elogic, from logikós, 'of or pertaining to reason or speech') was the study of existence, causation, God, logic, forms, and other abstract objects(meta ta physika, 'after the Physics')In Against the Logicians the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus detailed the variety of ways in which the ancient Greek philosophers had divided philosophy, noting that this three-part division was agreed to by Plato, Aristotle, Xenocrates, and the Stoics",4
"The Academic Skeptic philosopher Cicero also followed this three-part division.This division is not obsolete, but has changed: natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences, especially physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, and cosmology; moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences, while still including value theory (e.gethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, etc.); and metaphysical philosophy has given way to formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and philosophy of science, while still including epistemology, cosmology, etc",4
"For example, Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1687), since classified as a book of physics, uses the term natural philosophy as it was understood at the time, encompassing disciplines such as astronomy, medicine and physics that later became associated with the sciences    Historical overview   In one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture, and a search for knowledgeIn this sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions, such as ""how are we to live"" and ""what is the nature of reality."" A broad and impartial conception of philosophy, then, finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality, morality, and life in all world civilizations",4
"    Western philosophy    Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world, dating back to pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in 6th-century Greece (BCE), such as Thales (c. 624 – c. 545 BCE) and Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE) who practiced a 'love of wisdom' (Latin: philosophia) and were also termed 'students of nature' (physiologoi)Western philosophy can be divided into three eras: Ancient (Greco-Roman)Medieval philosophy (referring to Christian European thought)",4
"Modern philosophy (beginning in the 17th century)     Ancient era    While our knowledge of the ancient era begins with Thales in the 6th century BCE, little is known about the philosophers who came before Socrates (commonly known as the pre-Socratics)The ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schoolsMost notable among the schools influenced by Socrates' teachings were Plato, who founded the Platonic Academy, and his student Aristotle, who founded the Peripatetic school",4
"Other ancient philosophical traditions influenced by Socrates included Cynicism, Cyrenaicism, Stoicism, and Academic SkepticismTwo other traditions were influenced by Socrates' contemporary, Democritus: Pyrrhonism and EpicureanismImportant topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics (with competing theories such as atomism and monism), cosmology, the nature of the well-lived life (eudaimonia), the possibility of knowledge, and the nature of reason (logos)With the rise of the Roman empire, Greek philosophy was increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca (see Roman philosophy)",4
"     Medieval era    Medieval philosophy (5th–16th centuries) is the period following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and hence reflects Judeo-Christian theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thoughtProblems such as the existence and nature of God, the nature of faith and reason, metaphysics, the problem of evil were discussed in this periodSome key medieval thinkers include StAugustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon",4
"Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to theology (ancilla theologiae) and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scriptureThis period saw the development of scholasticism, a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close reading and disputation on key textsThe Renaissance period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust humanism     Modern era     Early modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes (1596–1650)",4
"Following the rise of natural science, modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the ChurchMajor modern philosophers include Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant19th-century philosophy (sometimes called late modern philosophy) was influenced by the wider 18th-century movement termed ""the Enlightenment"", and includes figures such as Hegel a key figure in German idealism, Kierkegaard who developed the foundations for existentialism, Nietzsche a famed anti-Christian, John Stuart Mill who promoted utilitarianism, Karl Marx who developed the foundations for communism and the American William James",4
"The 20th century saw the split between analytic philosophy and continental philosophy, as well as philosophical trends such as phenomenology, existentialism, logical positivism, pragmatism and the linguistic turn (see Contemporary philosophy)    Middle Eastern philosophy        Pre-Islamic philosophy    The regions of the Fertile Crescent, Iran and Arabia are home to the earliest known philosophical wisdom literature and is today mostly dominated by Islamic cultureAccording to the assyriologist Marc Van De Mieroop, Babylonian philosophy was a highly developed system of thought with a unique approach to knowledge and a focus on writing, lexicography, divination, and law",4
"It was also a bilingual intellectual culture, based on Sumerian and Akkadian Early Wisdom Literature from the Fertile Crescent was a genre that sought to instruct people on ethical action, practical living, and virtue through stories and proverbsIn Ancient Egypt, these texts were known as sebayt ('teachings') and they are central to our understandings of Ancient Egyptian philosophyThe most well known of these texts is The Maxims of PtahhotepTheology and cosmology was a central concern in Egyptian thought",4
"Perhaps the earliest form of a monotheistic theology also emerged in Egypt, with the rise of the Amarna theology (or Atenism) of Akhenaten (14th century BCE), which held that the solar creation deity Aten was the only godThis has been described as a ""monotheistic revolution"" by egyptologist Jan Assmann, though it also drew on previous developments in Egyptian thought, particularly the ""New Solar Theology"" based around Amun-RaThese theological developments also influenced the post-Amarna Ramesside theology, which retained a focus on a single creative solar deity (though without outright rejection of other gods, which are now seen as manifestations of the main solar deity)",4
"This period also saw the development of the concept of the ba (soul) and its relation to god.Jewish philosophy and Christian philosophy are religious-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, which both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the Tanakh) and monotheistic beliefsJewish thinkers such as the Geonim of the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia and Maimonides engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophyLater Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of Moses Mendelssohn who ushered in the Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment), Jewish existentialism, and Reform Judaism",4
"The various traditions of Gnosticism, which were influenced by both Greek and Abrahamic currents, originated around the first century and emphasized spiritual knowledge (gnosis)Pre-Islamic Iranian philosophy begins with the work of Zoroaster, one of the first promoters of monotheism and of the dualism between good and evilThis dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as Manichaeism, Mazdakism, and Zurvanism     Islamic philosophy     Islamic philosophy is the philosophical work originating in the Islamic tradition and is mostly done in Arabic",4
"It draws from the religion of Islam as well as from Greco-Roman philosophyAfter the Muslim conquests, the translation movement (mid-eighth to the late tenth century) resulted in the works of Greek philosophy becoming available in Arabic.Early Islamic philosophy developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directionsThis intellectual work inaugurated what is known as the Islamic Golden AgeThe two main currents of early Islamic thought are Kalam, which focuses on Islamic theology, and Falsafa, which was based on Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism",4
"The work of Aristotle was very influential among philosophers such as Al-Kindi (9th century), Avicenna (980 – June 1037), and Averroes (12th century)Others such as Al-Ghazali were highly critical of the methods of the Islamic Aristotelians and saw their metaphysical ideas as hereticalIslamic thinkers like Ibn al-Haytham and Al-Biruni also developed a scientific method, experimental medicine, a theory of optics, and a legal philosophyIbn Khaldun was an influential thinker in philosophy of history",4
"Islamic thought also deeply influenced European intellectual developments, especially through the commentaries of Averroes on AristotleThe Mongol invasions and the destruction of Baghdad in 1258 is often seen as marking the end of the Golden AgeSeveral schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age, however, and include currents such as Illuminationist philosophy, Sufi philosophy, and Transcendent theosophyThe 19th- and 20th-century Arab world saw the Nahda movement (literally meaning 'The Awakening'; also known as the 'Arab Renaissance'), which had a considerable influence on contemporary Islamic philosophy",4
"    Eastern philosophy        Indian philosophy     Indian philosophy (Sanskrit: darśana, lit. 'point of view', 'perspective') refers to the diverse philosophical traditions that emerged since the ancient times on the Indian subcontinentIndian philosophical traditions share various key concepts and ideas, which are defined in different ways and accepted or rejected by the different traditionsThese include concepts such as dhárma, karma, pramāṇa, duḥkha, saṃsāra and mokṣaSome of the earliest surviving Indian philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE), which are considered to preserve the ideas of Brahmanism",4
"Indian philosophy is commonly grouped based on their relationship to the Vedas and the ideas contained in themJainism and Buddhism originated at the end of the Vedic period, while the various traditions grouped under Hinduism mostly emerged after the Vedic period as independent traditionsHindus generally classify Indian philosophical traditions as either orthodox (āstika) or heterodox (nāstika) depending on whether they accept the authority of the Vedas and the theories of brahman and ātman found therein.The schools which align themselves with the thought of the Upanishads, the so-called ""orthodox"" or ""Hindu"" traditions, are often classified into six darśanas or philosophies:Sānkhya, Yoga, Nyāya, Vaisheshika, Mimāmsā and Vedānta.The doctrines of the Vedas and Upanishads were interpreted differently by these six schools of Hindu philosophy, with varying degrees of overlap",4
"They represent a ""collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection,"" according to Chadha (2015)They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation.Hindu philosophers of the six orthodox schools developed systems of epistemology (pramana) and investigated topics such as metaphysics, ethics, psychology (guṇa), hermeneutics, and soteriology within the framework of the Vedic knowledge, while presenting a diverse collection of interpretationsThe commonly named six orthodox schools were the competing philosophical traditions of what has been called the ""Hindu synthesis"" of classical Hinduism.There are also other schools of thought which are often seen as ""Hindu"", though not necessarily orthodox (since they may accept different scriptures as normative, such as the Shaiva Agamas and Tantras), these include different schools of Shavism such as Pashupata, Shaiva Siddhanta, non-dual tantric Shavism (i.e",4
"Trika, Kaula, etc.) The ""Hindu"" and ""Orthodox"" traditions are often contrasted with the ""unorthodox"" traditions (nāstika, literally ""those who reject""), though this is a label that is not used by the ""unorthodox"" schools themselvesThese traditions reject the Vedas as authoritative and often reject major concepts and ideas that are widely accepted by the orthodox schools (such as Ātman, Brahman, and Īśvara)These unorthodox schools include Jainism (accepts ātman but rejects Īśvara, Vedas and Brahman), Buddhism (rejects all orthodox concepts except rebirth and karma), Cārvāka (materialists who reject even rebirth and karma) and Ājīvika (known for their doctrine of fate).Jain philosophy is one of the only two surviving ""unorthodox"" traditions (along with Buddhism)",4
"It generally accepts the concept of a permanent soul (jiva) as one of the five astikayas (eternal, infinite categories that make up the substance of existence)The other four being dhárma, adharma, ākāśa ('space'), and pudgala ('matter')Jain thought holds that all existence is cyclic, eternal and uncreated.Some of the most important elements of Jain philosophy are the Jain theory of karma, the doctrine of nonviolence (ahiṃsā) and the theory of ""many-sidedness"" or Anēkāntavāda",4
"The Tattvartha Sutra is the earliest known, most comprehensive and authoritative compilation of Jain philosophy     Buddhist philosophy     Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of Gautama Buddha (flbetween 6th and 4th century BCE) and is preserved in the early Buddhist textsIt originated in the Indian region of Magadha and later spread to the rest of the Indian subcontinent, East Asia, Tibet, Central Asia, and Southeast AsiaIn these regions, Buddhist thought developed into different philosophical traditions which used various languages (like Tibetan, Chinese and Pali)",4
"As such, Buddhist philosophy is a trans-cultural and international phenomenonThe dominant Buddhist philosophical traditions in East Asian nations are mainly based on Indian Mahayana BuddhismThe philosophy of the Theravada school is dominant in Southeast Asian countries like Sri Lanka, Burma and ThailandBecause ignorance to the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering (dukkha), Buddhist philosophy is concerned with epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychologyBuddhist philosophical texts must also be understood within the context of meditative practices which are supposed to bring about certain cognitive shifts.: 8  Key innovative concepts include the four noble truths as an analysis of dukkha, anicca (impermanence), and anatta (non-self).After the death of the Buddha, various groups began to systematize his main teachings, eventually developing comprehensive philosophical systems termed Abhidharma.: 37  Following the Abhidharma schools, Indian Mahayana philosophers such as Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu developed the theories of śūnyatā ('emptiness of all phenomena') and vijñapti-matra ('appearance only'), a form of phenomenology or transcendental idealism",4
"The Dignāga school of pramāṇa ('means of knowledge') promoted a sophisticated form of Buddhist epistemologyThere were numerous schools, sub-schools, and traditions of Buddhist philosophy in ancient and medieval IndiaAccording to Oxford professor of Buddhist philosophy Jan Westerhoff, the major Indian schools from 300 BCE to 1000 CE were:: xxiv  the Mahāsāṃghika tradition (now extinct), the Sthavira schools (such as Sarvāstivāda, Vibhajyavāda and Pudgalavāda) and the Mahayana schoolsMany of these traditions were also studied in other regions, like Central Asia and China, having been brought there by Buddhist missionaries",4
"After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, some of these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the Tibetan Buddhist, East Asian Buddhist and Theravada Buddhist traditions     East Asian philosophy     East Asian philosophical thought began in Ancient China, and Chinese philosophy begins during the Western Zhou Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the ""Hundred Schools of Thought"" flourished (6th century to 221 BCE)This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China such as Confucianism (also known as Ruism), Legalism, and Taoism as well as numerous other less influential schools like Mohism and Naturalism",4
"These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such Tao, Yin and yang, Ren and LiThese schools of thought further developed during the Han (206 BCE – 220 CE) and Tang (618–907 CE) eras, forming new philosophical movements like Xuanxue (also called Neo-Taoism), and Neo-ConfucianismNeo-Confucianism was a syncretic philosophy, which incorporated the ideas of different Chinese philosophical traditions, including Buddhism and TaoismNeo-Confucianism came to dominate the education system during the Song dynasty (960–1297), and its ideas served as the philosophical basis of the imperial exams for the scholar official class",4
"Some of the most important Neo-Confucian thinkers are the Tang scholars Han Yu and Li Ao as well as the Song thinkers Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073) and Zhu Xi (1130–1200)Zhu Xi compiled the Confucian canon, which consists of the Four Books (the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, the Analects of Confucius, and the Mencius)The Ming scholar Wang Yangming (1472–1529) is a later but important philosopher of this tradition as well",4
"Buddhism began arriving in China during the Han Dynasty, through a gradual Silk road transmission and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/Zen) which spread throughout the East Asian cultural sphereChinese culture was highly influential on the traditions of other East Asian states and its philosophy directly influenced Korean philosophy, Vietnamese philosophy and Japanese philosophyDuring later Chinese dynasties like the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean Joseon dynasty (1392–1897) a resurgent Neo-Confucianism led by thinkers such as Wang Yangming (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state",4
"In Japan, the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867) was also strongly influenced by Confucian philosophyConfucianism continues to influence the ideas and worldview of the nations of the Chinese cultural sphere todayIn the Modern era, Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophyChinese Marxist philosophy developed under the influence of Mao Zedong, while a Chinese pragmatism developed under Hu ShihThe old traditional philosophies also began to reassert themselves in the 20th century",4
"For example, New Confucianism, led by figures such as Xiong Shili, has become quite influentialLikewise, Humanistic Buddhism is a recent modernist Buddhist movementModern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences (Rangaku) and the modernist Meirokusha intellectual society which drew from European enlightenment thought and promoted liberal reforms as well as Western philosophies like Liberalism and UtilitarianismAnother trend in modern Japanese philosophy was the ""National Studies"" (Kokugaku) tradition",4
"This intellectual trend sought to study and promote ancient Japanese thought and cultureKokugaku thinkers such as Motoori Norinaga sought to return to a pure Japanese tradition which they called Shinto that they saw as untainted by foreign elementsDuring the 20th century, the Kyoto School, an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school developed from Western phenomenology and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of Dogen    African philosophy    African philosophy is philosophy produced by African people, philosophy that presents African worldviews, ideas and themes, or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods",4
"Modern African thought has been occupied with Ethnophilosophy, with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be African.During the 17th century, Ethiopian philosophy developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by Zera YacobAnother early African philosopher was Anton Wilhelm Amo (c1703–1759) who became a respected philosopher in GermanyDistinct African philosophical ideas include Ujamaa, the Bantu idea of 'Force', Négritude, Pan-Africanism and Ubuntu",4
"Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of Africana philosophy, the philosophical literature of the African diaspora which includes currents such as black existentialism by African-AmericansSome modern African thinkers have been influenced by Marxism, African-American literature, Critical theory, Critical race theory, Postcolonialism and Feminism    Indigenous American philosophy    Indigenous-American philosophical thought consists of a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among different American culturesAmong some of U.S",4
"Native American communities, there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the 'Great Spirit'  (Siouan: wakȟáŋ tȟáŋka; Algonquian: gitche manitou)Another widely shared concept was that of orenda ('spiritual power')According to Whiteley (1998), for the Native Americans, ""mind is critically informed by transcendental experience (dreams, visions and so on) as well as by reason."" The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed shamanismAnother feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants.In Mesoamerica, Nahua philosophy was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called tlamatini ('those who know something') and its ideas are preserved in various Aztec codices and fragmentary texts",4
"Some of these philosophers are known by name, such as Nezahualcoyotl, Aquiauhtzin, Xayacamach, Tochihuitzin coyolchiuhqui and Cuauhtencoztli These authors were also poets and some of their work has survived in the original Nahuatl.Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aestheticsAztec ethics was focused on seeking tlamatiliztli ('knowledge', 'wisdom') which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua proverb ""the middle good is necessary."" The Nahua worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called Ōmeteōtl ('Dual Cosmic Energy') which sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing, ""slippery"" world",4
"The theory of Teotl can be seen as a form of PantheismAccording to James Maffie, Nahua metaphysics posited that teotl is ""a single, vital, dynamic, vivifying, eternally self-generating and self-conceiving as well as self-regenerating and self-reconceiving sacred energy or force."" This force was seen as the all encompassing life force of the universe and as the universe itself The Inca civilization also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the amawtakuna or amautas who were important in the Inca education system as teachers of philosophy, theology, astronomy, poetry, law, music, morality and history",4
"Young Inca nobles were educated in these disciplines at the state college of Yacha-huasi in Cuzco, where they also learned the art of the quipuIncan philosophy (as well as the broader category of Andean thought) held that the universe is animated by a single dynamic life force (sometimes termed camaquen or camac, as well as upani and amaya)This singular force also arises as a set of dual complementary yet opposite forces",4
"These “complementary opposites” are called yanantin and masintinThey are expressed as various polarities or dualities (such as male–female, dark–light, life and death, above and below) which interdependently contribute to the harmonious whole that is the universe through the process of reciprocity and mutual exchange called ayniThe Inca worldview also included the belief in a creator God (Viracocha) and reincarnation    Women in philosophy    Although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse, women philosophers have engaged in the discipline throughout history",4
"Ancient examples include Hipparchia of Maroneia (active c. 325 BCE) and Arete of Cyrene (active 5th–4th centuries BCE)Some women philosophers were accepted during the medieval and modern eras, but none became part of the Western canon until the 20th and 21st century, when many suggest that G.E.MAnscombe, Hannah Arendt, Simone de Beauvoir, and Susanne Langer entered the canon.In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and the US began admitting women, producing more female academics",4
"Nevertheless, U.SDepartment of Education reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy and that philosophy is one of the least gender-proportionate fields in the humanities, with women making up somewhere between 17% and 30% of philosophy faculty according to some studies    Philosophical progress   Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated todayBritish philosopher Colin McGinn claims that no philosophical progress has occurred during that interval",4
"Australian philosopher David Chalmers, by contrast, sees progress in philosophy similar to that in scienceMeanwhile, Talbot Brewer, professor of philosophy at University of Virginia, argues that ""progress"" is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity    Branches of philosophy   Philosophical questions can be grouped into various branchesThese groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions",4
"These divisions are neither exhaustive, nor mutually exclusive(A philosopher might specialize in Kantian epistemology, or Platonic aesthetics, or modern political philosophy)Furthermore, these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science, religion or mathematics    Aesthetics    Aesthetics is the ""critical reflection on art, culture and nature."" It addresses the nature of art, beauty and taste, enjoyment, emotional values, perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty",4
"It is more precisely defined as the study of sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of sentiment and tasteIts major divisions are art theory, literary theory, film theory and music theoryAn example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the Cubist aesthetic    Ethics    Ethics, also known as moral philosophy, studies what constitutes good and bad conduct, right and wrong values, and good and evil",4
"Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of moralityIt also includes investigating whether or not there is a best way to live or a universal moral standard, and if so, how we come to learn about itThe main branches of ethics are normative ethics, meta-ethics and applied ethics.The three main views in ethics about what constitute moral actions are: Consequentialism, which judges actions based on their consequences",4
"One such view is utilitarianism, which judges actions based on the net happiness (or pleasure) and/or lack of suffering (or pain) that they produceDeontology, which judges actions based on whether or not they are in accordance with one's moral dutyIn the standard form defended by Immanuel Kant, deontology is concerned with whether or not a choice respects the moral agency of other people, regardless of its consequencesVirtue ethics, which judges actions based on the moral character of the agent who performs them and whether they conform to what an ideally virtuous agent would do",4
"    Epistemology    Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledgeEpistemologists examine putative sources of knowledge, including perceptual experience, reason, memory, and testimonyThey also investigate questions about the nature of truth, belief, justification, and rationality.Philosophical skepticism, which raises doubts about some or all claims to knowledge, has been a topic of interest throughout the history of philosophyIt arose early in Pre-Socratic philosophy and became formalized with Pyrrho, the founder of the earliest Western school of philosophical skepticism",4
"It features prominently in the works of modern philosophers René Descartes and David Hume, and has remained a central topic in contemporary epistemological debates.One of the most notable epistemological debates is between empiricism and rationalismEmpiricism places emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledgeEmpiricism is associated with a posteriori knowledge, which is obtained through experience (such as scientific knowledge)Rationalism places emphasis on reason as a source of knowledge",4
"Rationalism is associated with a priori knowledge, which is independent of experience (such as logic and mathematics)One central debate in contemporary epistemology is about the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge, which might include truth and justificationThis debate was largely the result of attempts to solve the Gettier problemAnother common subject of contemporary debates is the regress problem, which occurs when trying to offer proof or justification for any belief, statement, or proposition",4
"The problem is that whatever the source of justification may be, that source must either be without justification (in which case it must be treated as an arbitrary foundation for belief), or it must have some further justification (in which case justification must either be the result of circular reasoning, as in coherentism, or the result of an infinite regress, as in infinitism)    Metaphysics    Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality, such as existence, time, objects and their properties, wholes and their parts, events, processes and causation and the relationship between mind and body",4
"Metaphysics includes cosmology, the study of the world in its entirety and ontology, the study of beingA major point of debate is between realism, which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception, and idealism, which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterialMetaphysics deals with the topic of identityEssence is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while accident is a property that the object has, without which the object can still retain its identity",4
"Particulars are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to abstract objects, such as numbers, and universals, which are properties held by multiple particulars, such as redness or a genderThe type of existence, if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate    Logic    Logic is the study of reasoning and argumentDeductive reasoning is when, given certain premises, conclusions are unavoidably impliedRules of inference are used to infer conclusions such as, modus ponens, where given “A” and “If A then B”, then “B” must be concluded",4
"Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences, social sciences and humanities disciplines, logic became a formal scienceSub-fields include mathematical logic, philosophical logic, Modal logic, computational logic and non-classical logicsA major question in the philosophy of mathematics is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered, called mathematical realism, or invented, called mathematical antirealism    Mind and language    Philosophy of language explores the nature, origins, and use of languagePhilosophy of mind explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body, as typified by disputes between materialism and dualism",4
"In recent years, this branch has become related to cognitive science    Philosophy of science    The philosophy of science explores the foundations, methods, history, implications and purpose of scienceMany of its subdivisions correspond to specific branches of scienceFor example, philosophy of biology deals specifically with the metaphysical, epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences    Political philosophy    Political philosophy is the study of government and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the state",4
"It includes questions about justice, law, property and the rights and obligations of the citizenPolitical philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics are traditionally linked subjects, under the general heading of value theory as they involve a normative or evaluative aspect    Philosophy of religion    Philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve religion and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective (as opposed to theology which begins from religious convictions)Traditionally, religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper, the idea of a separate field only arose in the 19th century.Issues include the existence of God, the relationship between reason and faith, questions of religious epistemology, the relationship between religion and science, how to interpret religious experiences, questions about the possibility of an afterlife, the problem of religious language and the existence of souls and responses to religious pluralism and diversity",4
"    Metaphilosophy    Metaphilosophy explores the aims, boundaries and methods of philosophyIt is debated as to whether Metaphilosophy is a subject that comes prior to philosophy or whether it is inherently part of philosophy    Applied and professional philosophy    Some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers, typically by working as professors who teach, research and write in academic institutionsHowever, most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law, journalism, religion, sciences, politics, business, or various arts",4
"For example, public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians Steve Martin and Ricky Gervais, filmmaker Terrence Malick, Pope John Paul II, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger, technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel, U.SSupreme Court Justice Stephen Bryer and US vice presidential candidate Carly FiorinaCurtis White has argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities, sciences and social sciences.Recent efforts to avail the general public to the work and relevance of philosophers include the million-dollar Berggruen Prize, first awarded to Charles Taylor in 2016",4

"Erotic literature comprises fictional and factual stories and accounts of eros (passionate, romantic or sexual relationships) intended to arouse similar feelings in readersThis contrasts erotica, which focuses more specifically on sexual feelingsOther common elements are satire and social criticismMuch erotic literature features erotic art, illustrating the textAlthough cultural disapproval of erotic literature has always existed, its circulation was not seen as a major problem before the invention of printing, as the costs of producing individual manuscripts limited distribution to a very small group of wealthy and literate readers",5
"The invention of printing, in the 15th century, brought with it both a greater market and increasing restrictions, including censorship and legal restraints on publication on the grounds of obscenityBecause of this, much of the production of this type of material became clandestine    Erotic verse       Early periods   The oldest love poem ever found is Istanbul 2461, an erotic monologue written by a female speaker directed to king Shu-Sin.In ancient Sumer, a whole cycle of poems revolved around the erotic lovemaking between the goddess Inanna and her consort Dumuzid the Shepherd.In the Hebrew Bible, the Song of Songs, found in the last section of the Tanakh, celebrates sexual love, giving ""the voices of two lovers, praising each other, yearning for each other, proffering invitations to enjoy"".Many erotic poems have survived from ancient Greece and Rome",5
"The Greek poets Straton of Sardis and Sappho of Lesbos both wrote erotic lyric poemsThe poet Archilochus wrote numerous satirical poems filled with obscene and erotic imageryErotic poems continued to be written in Hellenistic and Roman times by writers like  Automedon (The Professional and Demetrius the Fortunate), Philodemus (Charito) and Marcus ArgentariusNotable Roman erotic poets included Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, Martial and Juvenal, and the anonymous PriapeiaSome later Latin authors such as Joannes Secundus also wrote erotic verse",5
"Haft Peykar (Persian: هفت پیکر) also known as Bahramnameh (بهرام‌نامه, The Book of Bahram) is a romantic epic by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi written in 1197This poem is a part of the Nizami's KhamsaThe original title Haft Peykar can be translated literally as “seven portraits” with the figurative meaning of “seven beauties.” The poem is a masterpiece of erotic literature, but it is also a profoundly moralistic work.During the Renaissance period, many poems were not written for publication; instead, they were merely circulated in manuscript form among a relatively limited readership",5
"This was the original method of circulation for the Sonnets of William Shakespeare, who also wrote the erotic poems Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece    17th and 18th centuries    In the 17th century, John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (1647–80) was notorious for obscene verses, many of which were published posthumously in compendiums of poetry by him and other ""Restoration rakes"" such as Sir Charles Sedley, Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset, and George Etherege",5
"Though many of the poems attributed to Rochester were actually by other authors, his reputation as a libertine was such that his name was used as a selling point by publishers of collections of erotic verse for centuries afterOne poem definitely by him was ""A Ramble in StJames's Park,"" in which the protagonist's quest for healthy exercise in the park uncovers instead ""Bugg'ries, Rapes and Incest"" on ground polluted by debauchery from the time when ""Ancient Pict began to Whore""",5
"This poem was being censored from collections of Rochester's poetry as late as 1953, though, in line with the subsequent general change in attitudes to sexuality, it was dramatised as a scene in the film The Libertine about his life, based on an existing play.English collections of erotic verse by various hands include the Drollery collections of the 17th century; Pills to Purge Melancholy (1698–1720); the Roxburghe Ballads; Bishop Percy's Folio; The Musical Miscellany; National Ballad and Song: Merry Songs and Ballads Prior to the Year AD 1800 (1895–97) edited by J",5
"SFarmer; the three volume Poetica Erotica (1921) and its more obscene supplement the Immortalia (1927) both edited by TRSmithFrench collections include Les Muses gaillardes (1606) Le Cabinet satyrique (1618) and La Parnasse des poetes satyriques (1622).A famous collection of four erotic poems, was published in England in 1763, called An Essay on WomanThis included the title piece, an obscene parody of Alexander Pope's ""An Essay on Man""; ""Veni Creator: or, The Maid's Prayer"", which is original; the ""Universal Prayer"", an obscene parody of Pope's poem of the same name, and ""The Dying Lover to his Prick"", which parodies ""A Dying Christian to his Soul"" by Pope",5
"These poems have been attributed to John Wilkes and/or Thomas Potter and receive the distinction of being the only works of erotic literature ever read out loud and in their entirety in the House of Lords—before being declared obscene and blasphemous by that body and the supposed author, Wilkes, declared an outlaw.Robert Burns worked to collect and preserve Scottish folk songs, sometimes revising, expanding, and adapting themOne of the better known of these collections is The Merry Muses of Caledonia (the title is not by Burns), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century",5
"    19th century    One of the 19th century's foremost poets—Algernon Charles Swinburne—devoted much of his considerable talent to erotic verse, producing, inter alia, twelve eclogues on flagellation titled The Flogging Block ""by Rufus Rodworthy, annotated by Barebum Birchingly""; more was published anonymously in The Whippingham Papers (c1888) Another notorious anonymous 19th-century poem on the same subject is The Rodiad, ascribed (seemingly falsely and in jest) to George Colman the Younger John Camden Hotten even wrote a pornographic comic opera, Lady Bumtickler’s Revels, on the theme of flagellation in 1872.Pierre Louÿs helped found a literary review, La Conque in 1891, where he proceeded to publish Astarte—an early collection of erotic verse already marked by his distinctive elegance and refinement of style",5
"He followed up in 1894 with another erotic collection in 143 prose poems—Songs of Bilitis (Les Chansons de Bilitis), this time with strong lesbian themes    20th century   Although DHLawrence could be regarded as a writer of love poems, he usually dealt in the less romantic aspects of love such as sexual frustration or the sex act itselfEzra Pound, in his Literary Essays, complained of Lawrence's interest in his own ""disagreeable sensations"" but praised him for his ""low-life narrative."" This is a reference to Lawrence's dialect poems akin to the Scots poems of Robert Burns, in which he reproduced the language and concerns of the people of Nottinghamshire from his youth",5
"He called one collection of poems Pansies partly for the simple ephemeral nature of the verse but also a pun on the French word panser, to dress or bandage a wound""The Noble Englishman"" and ""Don't Look at Me"" were removed from the official edition of Pansies on the grounds of obscenity; Lawrence felt wounded by this.From the age of 17, Gavin Ewart acquired a reputation for wit and accomplishment through such works as ""Phallus in Wonderland"" and ""Poems and Songs"", which appeared in 1939 and was his first collection",5
"The intelligence and casually flamboyant virtuosity with which he framed his often humorous commentaries on human behaviour made his work invariably entertaining and interestingThe irreverent eroticism for which his poetry is noted resulted in W H Smith's banning of his ""The Pleasures of the Flesh"" (1966) from their shops.Canadian poet John Glassco wrote Squire Hardman (1967), a long poem in heroic couplets, purporting to be a reprint of an 18th-century poem by George Colman the Younger, on the theme of flagellation.Also, the Italian Una Chi distinguished herself among other publications for coldly analytical prose and for the crudeness of the stories",5
"    Erotic fiction   Erotic fiction is fiction that portrays sex or sexual themes, generally in a more literary or serious way than the fiction seen in pornographic magazinesIt sometimes includes elements of satire or social criticismSuch works have frequently been banned by the government or religious authoritiesNon-fictional works that portray sex or sexual themes may contain fictional elementsCalling an erotic book 'a memoir' is a literary device that is common in this genre",5
"For reasons similar to those that make pseudonyms both commonplace and often deviously set up, the boundary between fiction and non-fiction is broad Erotic fiction has been credited in large part for the sexual awakening and liberation of women in the 20th and 21st centuries    History of western erotic fiction        Ancient, medieval, and early modern periods     The Satyricon of Petronius Arbiter (later made into a film by Fellini) is an ancient Roman novel, which has partially survived, narrating the misadventures of an impotent man named Encolpius, who has been cursed by the god Priapus",5
"The novel is filled with bawdy and obscene episodes, including orgies, ritual sex, and other erotic incidentsThe discovery of several fragments of Lollianos's Phoenician Tale reveal that a genre of picaresque erotic novel also existed in ancient GreeceSome of the ancient Greek romance novels, such as Daphnis and Chloe, also contain elements of sexual fantasy.From the medieval period, there is the Decameron (1353) by the Italian Giovanni Boccaccio (made into a film by Pasolini) which features tales of lechery by monks and the seduction of nuns from convents",5
"This book was banned in many countriesEven five centuries after publication copies were seized and destroyed by the authorities in the US and the UKFor instance between 1954 and 1958 eight orders for destruction of the book were made by English magistrates.From the 15th century, another classic of Italian erotica is a series of bawdy folk tales called the Facetiae by Gian Francesco Poggio BraccioliniThe Tale of Two Lovers (Latin: Historia de duobus amantibus) written in 1444 was one of the bestselling books of the 15th century, even before its author, Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, became Pope Pius II",5
"It is one of the earliest examples of an epistolary novel, full of erotic imageryThe first printed edition was published by Ulrich Zel in Cologne between 1467 and 1470.The 16th century was notable for the Heptameron of Marguerite de Navarre (1558), inspired by Boccaccio's Decameron and the notorious I Modi which married erotic drawings, depicting postures assumed in sexual intercourse, by Giulio Romano, with obscene sonnets by Pietro Aretino.Aretino also wrote the celebrated whore dialogue Ragionamenti, in which the sex lives of wives, whores and nuns are compared and contrasted",5
" Later works in the same genre include La Retorica delle Puttane (The Whore's Rhetoric) (1642) by Ferrante Pallavicino; L'Ecole des Filles (The school for girls) (1655), attributed to Michel Millot and Jean L'Angeand The Dialogues of Luisa Sigea (c1660) by Nicolas Chorier Such works typically concerned the sexual education of a naive younger woman by an experienced older woman and often included elements of philosophising, satire and anti-clericalismDonald Thomas has translated L'École des filles, as The School of Venus, (1972), described on its back cover as ""both an uninhibited manual of sexual technique and an erotic masterpiece of the first order""",5
"In his diary Samuel Pepys records reading and (in an often censored passage) masturbating over this workChorier's  Dialogues of Luisa Sigea goes a bit further than its predecessors in this genre and has the older female giving practical instruction of a lesbian nature to the younger woman plus recommending the spiritual and erotic benefits of a flogging from willing members of the holy ordersThis work was translated into many languages under various different titles, appearing in English as A Dialogue between a Married Woman and a Maid in various editions",5
"The School of Women first appeared as a work in Latin entitled Aloisiae Sigaeae, Toletanae, Satyra sotadica de arcanis Amoris et VenerisThis manuscript claimed that it was originally written in Spanish by Luisa Sigea de Velasco, an erudite poet and maid of honor at the court of Lisbon and was then translated into Latin by Jean or Johannes MeursiusThe attribution to Sigea and Meursius was a lie; the true author was Nicolas Chorier",5
"A unique work of this time is Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery (1684), a closet play by the notorious Restoration rake, John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester in which Bolloxinion, King of Sodom, authorises ""that buggery may be used O'er all the land, so cunt be not abused"", which order, though appealing to soldiery, has deleterious effects generally, leading the court physician to counsel: ""Fuck women, and let Bugg'ry be no more""",5
"     18th century     An early pioneer of the publication of erotic works in England was Edmund Curll (1675–1747), who published many of the Merryland booksThese were an English genre of erotic fiction in which the female body (and sometimes the male) was described in terms of a landscapeThe earliest work in this genre seems to be Erotopolis: The Present State of Bettyland (1684) probably by Charles CottonThis was included, in abbreviated form, in The Potent Ally: or Succours from Merryland (1741)",5
"Other works include  A New Description of MerrylandContaining a Topographical, Geographical and Natural History of that Country (1740) by Thomas Stretzer, Merryland Displayed (1741) and set of maps entitled A Compleat Set of Charts of the Coasts of Merryland (1745)The last book in this genre appears to be a parody of Laurence Sterne's A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy (1768) entitled  La SouriciereThe MousetrapA Facetious and Sentimental Excursion through part of Austrian Flanders and France (1794) by ""Timothy Touchit"".The rise of the novel in 18th-century England provided a new medium for erotica",5
"One of the most famous in this genre was Fanny Hill (1748) by John ClelandThis book set a standard in literary smut and was often adapted for the cinema in the 20th centuryPeter Fryer suggests that Fanny Hill was a high point in British erotica, at least in the eighteenth century, in a way that mainstream literature around it had also reached a peak at that time, with writers like Defoe, Richardson and Fielding all having made important and lasting contributions to literature in its first half",5
"After 1750, he suggests, when the Romantic period began, the quality of mainstream writing and of smut declined in tandemWrites Fryer: ""sex was driven out of the English novel in the latter half of the eighteenth centuryThe castration of imaginative English literature made the clandestine literature of sex the most poverty stricken and boring in Europe"" French writers kept their strideOne genre, which vies in oddness with the English ""Merryland"" productions, was inspired by the newly translated Arabian Nights and involved the transformation of people into objects which were in propinquity with or employed in sexual relationships: such as sofas, dildos and even bidets",5
"The climax of this trend is represented in French philosopher Diderot's Les Bijoux indiscrets (1747) in which a magic ring is employed to get women's vaginas to give an account of their intimate sexual histories.Other works of French erotica from this period include Thérèse Philosophe (1748) by Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens which describes a girl's initiation into the secrets of both philosophy and sex.; The Lifted Curtain or Laura's Education, about a young girl's sexual initiation by her father, written by the French revolutionary politician Comte de Mirabeau; also Les Liaisons dangereuses (Dangerous Liaisons) by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, first published in 1782",5
"In the late 18th century, such works as Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue and 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade were exemplars of the theme of sado-masochism and influenced later erotic accounts of sadism and masochism in fictionDe Sade (as did the later writer Sacher-Masoch) lent his name to the sexual acts which he describes in his work     19th century    In the Victorian period, the quality of erotic fiction was much below that of the previous century—it was largely written by 'hacks'",5
"Some works, however, borrowed from established literary models, such as DickensThe period also featured a form of social stratificationEven in the throes of orgasm, the social distinctions between master and servant (including form of address) were scrupulously observedSignificant elements of sado-masochism were present in some examples, perhaps reflecting the influence of the English public school, where flagellation was routinely used as a punishmentThese clandestine works were often anonymous or written under a pseudonym, and sometimes undated, thus definite information about them often proves elusive",5
"English erotic novels from this period include The Lustful Turk (1828); The Romance of Lust (1873); The Convent School, or Early Experiences of A Young Flagellant (1876) by Rosa Coote [pseud.]; The Mysteries of Verbena House, or, Miss Bellasis Birched for Thieving (1882) by Etonensis [pseud.], actually by George Augustus Sala and James Campbell Reddie; The Autobiography of a Flea (1887); Venus in India (1889) by 'Captain Charles Devereaux'; Flossie, a Venus of Fifteen: By one who knew this Charming Goddess and worshipped at her shrine (1897)",5
"A novel called Beatrice, once marketed as another classic of Victorian erotica from the pen of the ubiquitous ""Anon"", now appears to be a very clever 20th-century pastiche of Victorian pornographyIt first appeared in 1982 and was written by one Gordon Grimley, a sometime managing director of Penthouse International.Clandestine erotic periodicals of this age include The Pearl, The Oyster and The Boudoir, collections of erotic tales, rhymes, songs and parodies published in London between 1879 and 1883",5
" The centre of the trade in such material in England at this period was Holywell Street, off the Strand, LondonAn important publisher of erotic material in the early 19th century was George Cannon (1789–1854), followed in mid-century by William Dugdale (1800–1868) and John Camden Hotten (1832–1873).An evaluation of 19th-century (pre-1885) and earlier underground erotica, from the author's own private archive, is provided by Victorian writer Henry Spencer Ashbee, using the pseudonym ""Pisanus Fraxi"", in his bibliographical trilogy Index Librorum Prohibitorum (1877), Centuria Librorum Absconditorum (1879) and Catena Librorum Tacendorum (1885)",5
"His plot summaries of the works he discusses in these privately printed volumes are themselves a contribution to the genreOriginally of very limited circulation, changing attitudes have led to his work now being widely available.Notable European works of erotica at this time were Gamiani, or Two Nights of Excess (1833) by Frenchman Alfred de Musset and Venus in Furs (1870) by the Austrian author Leopold von Sacher-MasochThe latter erotic novella brought the attention of the world to the phenomenon of masochism, named after the author",5
"Towards the end of the 19th century, a more ""cultured"" form of erotica began to appear by poets such as Algernon Charles Swinburne, who pursued themes of paganism, lesbianism and sado-masochism in such works as Lesbia Brandon and in contributions to The Whippingham Papers (1888) edited by St George Stock, author of The Romance of Chastisement (1866)This was associated with the Decadent movement, in particular, with Aubrey Beardsley and the Yellow Book",5
"But it was also to be found in France, amongst such writers as Pierre Louys, author of Les chansons de Bilitis (1894) (a celebration of lesbianism and sexual awakening)Pioneering works of gay male erotica from this time were The Sins of the Cities of the Plain (1881), which features the celebrated Victorian transvestite duo of Boulton and Park as characters, and Teleny, or The Reverse of the Medal (1893).Two important publishers of erotic fiction at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th were Leonard Smithers (1861–1907) and Charles Carrington (1867–1921), both of whom were subject to legal injunctions from the British authorities in order to prohibit their trade in such material",5
"Because of this legal harassment the latter conducted his business from ParisErotic fiction published by Carrington at this period includes Raped on the Railway: a True Story of a Lady who was first ravished and then flagellated on the Scotch Express (1894) and The Memoirs of Dolly Morton (1899) set on a slave-plantation in the Southern States of America     20th century    20th-century erotic fiction includes such classics of the genre as: Suburban Souls (1901), published by Carrington and possibly written by him also; The Confessions of Nemesis Hunt (issued in three volumes 1902, 1903, 1906), probably by George Reginald Bacchus, printed by Duringe of Paris for Leonard Smithers in London; Josephine Mutzenbacher (1906) by Anon",5

" The critic Charles Stone has argued that pornographic technique is the ""union of banality, obscenity, and repetition,"" and contains just the ""rudiments"" of plot, style, and characterization, while anything that is not sexually stimulating is avoidedIf this is the case, he concluded, then The Lord of Perfect Satisfaction is the ""fountainhead of Chinese erotica,"" but not pornography The novel Jin Ping Mei (or The Plum in the Golden Vase), written by an author who used only a pseudonym (as his real name is unknown), is generally regarded as the greatest of all Chinese erotic novels",5

"The debate was rekindled in 2012 by the release of the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy written by ELJamesThe success of her erotica for every woman, dubbed 'mommyporn', gave rise to satires like Fifty Shames of Earl Grey by 'Fanny Merkin' (real name Andrew Shaffer), a book of essays called Fifty Writers on Fifty Shades (edLori Perkins) and editors of erotic imprints re-evaluating the content and presentation of the genre.One development in contemporary erotica is the knowledge that many women, and not just men, are aroused by it",5

"After the Reformation the jurisdiction of these courts declined in favour of the Crown which licensed every printed bookProsecutions of books for their erotic content alone were rare and works which attacked the church or state gave much more concern to the authorities than erotica or 'obscene libel' as it was then knownFor instance the Licensing Act of 1662 was aimed generally at ""heretical, seditious, schismatical or offensive books of pamphlets"" rather than just erotica per se",5
"Even this Licensing Act was allowed to lapse in 1695 and no attempt made to renew itThe first conviction for obscenity in England occurred in 1727, when Edmund Curll was fined for the publication of Venus in the Cloister or The Nun in her Smock under the common law offence of disturbing the King's peaceThis set a legal precedent for other convictionsThe publication of other books by Curll, however, considered seditious and blasphemous, such as The Memoirs of John Ker, apparently most offended the authorities",5
"Prosecutions of erotica later in the 18th century were rare and were most often taken because of the admixture of seditious and blasphemous material with the porn     1857–1959     It was the Obscene Publications Act 1857 which made the sale of obscene material a statutory offence, for the first time, giving the courts power to seize and destroy offending materialThe origins of the Act itself were in a trial for the sale of pornography presided over by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Campbell, at the same time as a debate in the House of Lords over a bill aiming to restrict the sale of poisons",5
"Campbell was taken by the analogy between the two situations, famously referring to the London pornography trade as ""a sale of poison more deadly than prussic acid, strychnine or arsenic"", and proposed a bill to restrict the sale of pornography; giving statutory powers of destruction would allow for a much more effective degree of prosecutionThe bill was controversial at the time, receiving strong opposition from both Houses of Parliament, and was passed on the assurance by the Lord Chief Justice that it was ""..",5
"intended to apply exclusively to works written for the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth and of a nature calculated to shock the common feelings of decency in any well-regulated mind."" The House of Commons successfully amended it so as not to apply to Scotland, on the grounds that Scottish common law was sufficiently stringentThe Act provided for the seizure and destruction of any material deemed to be obscene, and held for sale or distribution, following information being laid before a ""court of summary jurisdiction"" (Magistrates' court)",5
"The Act required that following evidence of a common-law offence being committed – for example, on the report of a plain-clothes policeman who had successfully purchased the material – the court could issue a warrant for the premises to be searched and the material seizedThe proprietor then would be called upon to attend court and give reason why the material should not be destroyedCritically, the Act did not define ""obscene,"" leaving this to the will of the courts",5
"Whilst the Act itself did not change, the scope of the work affected by it didIn 1868 Sir Alexander Cockburn, Campbell's successor as Lord Chief Justice, held in an appeal that the test of obscenity was ""...whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall."" This was clearly a major change from Campbell's opinion only ten years before – the test now being the effect on someone open to corruption who obtained a copy, not whether the material was intended to corrupt or offend",5
"Cockburn's declaration remained in force for several decades, and most of the high profile seizures under the Act relied on this interpretationKnown as the Hicklin test no cognisance was taken of the literary merit of a book or on the extent of the offending text within the book in questionThe widened scope of the original legislation led to the subsequent notorious targeting of now acknowledged classics of world literature by such authors as Zola, James Joyce and D.H",5
"Lawrence plus medical textbooks by such as Havelock Ellis rather than the blatant erotica which was the original target of this law.In contrast to England, where actions against obscene literature were the preserve of the magistrates, in America such actions were the responsibility of the Postal Inspection Service, embodied in the federal and state Comstock laws, named after the postal officer and anti-obscenity crusader Anthony Comstock who proved himself officious in the work of suppression both in his official capacity and through his New York Society for the Suppression of Vice",5
" The first such law was the Comstock Act, (ch258 17 Stat598 enacted March 3, 1873) which made it illegal to send any ""obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious"" materials through the mailTwenty-four states passed similar prohibitions on materials distributed within the states    Modern legislation   This question of whether a book had literary merit eventually prompted a change in the law in both America and the UKIn the United Kingdom the Obscene Publications Act 1959 provided for the protection of ""literature"" but conversely increased the penalties against pure ""pornography."" The law defined obscenity and separated it from serious works of art",5
"The new definition read:  [A]n article shall be deemed to be obscene if its effect or (where the article comprises two or more distinct items) the effect of any one of its items is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in itAfter this piece of legislation questions of the literary merit of the work in question were allowed to be put before the judge and jury as in the Lady Chatterley trial",5
"The publishers of the latter book were found not guilty by the court on the grounds of the literary merit of the bookIn later prosecutions of literary erotica under the provisions of the act, however, even purely pornographic works with no apparent literary merit escaped destruction by the authoritiesPurely textual pornographic texts, with no hint of libel, ceased to be brought to trial following the collapse of the Inside Linda Lovelace trial in 1976",5
" However, in October 2008, a man was unsuccessfully prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act (the R v Walker trial) for posting fictional written material to the Internet allegedly describing the kidnap, rape and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud.The First Amendment to the United States Constitution gives protection to written fiction, although the legal presumption that it does not protect obscene literature has never been overcomeInstead, pornography has successfully been defined legally as non-obscene, or ""obscene"" been shown to be so vague a term as to be unenforceable",5
"In 1998 Brian Dalton was charged with creation and possession of child pornography under an Ohio obscenity lawThe stories were works of fiction concerning sexually abusing children which he wrote and kept, unpublished, in his private journalHe accepted a plea bargain, pleaded guilty and was convictedFive years later, the conviction was vacatedImporting books and texts across national borders can sometimes be subject to more stringent laws than in the nations concerned",5
"Customs officers are often permitted to seize even merely 'indecent' works that would be perfectly legal to sell and possess once one is inside the nations concernedCanada has been implicated in such border seizures.Although the year 1857, as well as 1959 legislation, outlawed the publication, retail and trafficking of certain types of writings and images regarded as pornographic, and would order the destruction of shop and warehouse stock meant for sale, the private possession of and viewing of pornography was not prosecuted in those times",5
"In some nations, even purely textual erotic literature is still deemed illegal and is also prosecuted    See also       Notes       References   Brulotte, Gaëtan & Phillips, John (eds.)

"Grey literature (or gray literature) is materials and research produced by organizations outside of the traditional commercial or academic publishing and distribution channelsCommon grey literature publication types include reports (annual, research, technical, project, etc.), working papers, government documents, white papers and evaluationsOrganizations that produce grey literature include government departments and agencies, civil society or non-governmental organizations, academic centres and departments, and private companies and consultantsGrey literature may be made available to the public, or distributed privately within organizations or groups, and may lack a systematic means of distribution and collection",5
"The standard of quality, review and production of grey literature can vary considerablyGrey literature may be difficult to discover, access, and evaluate, but this can be addressed through the formulation of sound search strategies    Definitions   While a hazy definition of ""grey literature"" had existed previously, the term is generally understood to have been coined by the researcher Charles PAuger, who wrote Use of Reports Literature in 1975The literature he referred to consisted of intelligence reports and notes on atomic research produced in vast quantities by the Allied Forces during World War II",5
"In a conference held by the British Lending Library Division in 1978, Auger used the term ""grey literature"" to describe the concept for the first timeHis concepts focused upon a ""vast body of documents"" with ""continuing increasing quantity"" that were characterized by the ""difficulty it presents to the librarian""Auger described the documentation as having great ambiguity between temporary character and durability, and by a growing impact on scientific researchWhile acknowledging the challenges of reports literature, he recognized that it held a number of advantages ""over other means of dissemination, including greater speed, greater flexibility and the opportunity to go into considerable detail if necessary""",5
"Auger considered reports a ""half-published"" communication medium with a ""complex interrelationship [to] scientific journals""In 1989 Auger published the second edition of The Documentation of the European Communities: A Guide, which contained the first usage of the term ""grey literature"" in a published work.The ""Luxembourg definition"", discussed and approved at the Third International Conference on Grey Literature in 1997, defined grey literature as ""that which is produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in print and electronic formats, but which is not controlled by commercial publishers""",5
"In 2004, at the Sixth Conference in New York City, a postscript was added to the definition for purposes of clarification: grey literature is ""...not controlled by commercial publishers, i.e., where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body""This definition  is now widely accepted by the scholarly communityThe U.SInteragency Gray Literature Working Group (IGLWG), in its ""Gray Information Functional Plan"" of 1995, defined grey literature as ""foreign or domestic open source material that usually is available through specialized channels and may not enter normal channels or systems of publication, distribution, bibliographic control, or acquisition by booksellers or subscription agents""",5
"Thus grey literature is usually inaccessible through relevant reference tools such as databases and indexes, which rely upon the reporting of subscription agentsOther terms used for this material include: report literature, government publications, policy documents, fugitive literature, non-conventional literature, unpublished literature, non-traditional publications, and ephemeral publicationsWith the introduction of desktop publishing and the Internet, new terms include: electronic publications, online publications, online resources, open-access research, and digital documentsThough the concept is difficult to define, the term grey literature is an agreed collective term that researchers and information professionals can use to discuss this distinct but disparate group of resources",5
" In 2010, D.JFarace and JSchöpfel pointed out that existing definitions of grey literature were predominantly economic, and argued that in a changing research environment, with new channels of scientific communication, grey literature needed a new conceptual frameworkThey proposed the ""Prague definition"" as follows:Grey literature stands for manifold document types produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in print and electronic formats that are protected by intellectual property rights, of sufficient quality to be collected and preserved by library holdings or institutional repositories, but not controlled by commercial publishers i.e., where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body",5
"Due to the rapid increase web publishing and access to documents, the focus of grey literature has shifted to quality, intellectual property, curation, and accessibility    Publication types   The term grey literature acts as a collective noun to refer to a large number of publications types produced by organizations for various reasonsThese include: research and project reports, annual or activity reports, theses, conference proceedings, preprints, working papers, newsletters, technical reports, recommendations and technical standards, patents, technical notes, data and statistics, presentations, field notes, laboratory research books, academic courseware, lecture notes, evaluations, and many more",5
"The international network GreyNet maintains an online listing of document types.Organizations produce grey literature as a means of encapsulating, storing and sharing information for their own use, and for wider distributionThis can take the form of a record of data and information on a site or project (archaeological records, survey data, working papers); sharing information on how and why things occurred (technical reports and specifications, briefings, evaluations, project reports); describing and advocating for changes to public policy, practice or legislation (white papers, discussion papers, submissions); meeting statutory or other requirements for information sharing or management (annual reports, consultation documents); and many other reasons",5
"Organizations are often looking to create the required output, sharing it with relevant parties quickly and easily, without the delays and restrictions of academic journal and book publishingOften there is little incentive or justification for organizations or individuals to publish in academic journals and books, and often no need to charge for access to organizational outputsIndeed, some information organizations may be required to make certain information and documents publicOn the other hand, grey literature is not necessarily always free, with some resources, such as market reports, selling for thousands of dollars",5
"However, this is the exception and on the whole grey literature, while costly to produce, is usually made available for freeWhile production and research quality may be extremely high (with organizational reputation vested in the end product), the producing body, not being a formal publisher, generally lacks the channels for extensive distribution and bibliographic control.Information and research professionals generally draw a distinction between ephemera and grey literatureHowever, there are certain overlaps between the two media and they undoubtedly share common frustrations such as bibliographic control issues",5
"Unique written documents such as manuscripts and archives, and personal communications, are not usually considered to fall under the heading of grey literature, although they again share some of the same problems of control and access    Impact   The relative importance of grey literature is largely dependent on research disciplines and subjects, on methodological approaches, and on the sources they useIn some fields, especially in the life sciences and medical sciences, there has been a traditional preference for only using peer-reviewed academic journals while in others, such as agriculture, aeronautics and the engineering sciences in general, grey literature resources tend to predominate",5
"In the last few decades, systematic literature reviews in health and medicine have established the importance of discovering and analyzing grey literature as part of the evidence base and in order to avoid publication bias.Grey literature is particularly important as a means of distributing scientific and technical and public policy and practice informationProfessionals insist on its importance for two main reasons: research results are often more detailed in reports, doctoral theses and conference proceedings than in journals, and they are distributed in these forms up to 12 or even 18 months before being published elsewhere",5
"Some results simply are not published anywhere elseIn particular, public administrations and public and industrial research laboratories produce a great deal of “grey” material, often for internal and in some cases “restricted” disseminationThe notion of evidence-based policy has also seen some recognition of the importance of grey literature as part of the evidence base; however, the term is not yet widely used in public policy and the social sciences more broadly",5
"    Problems   For a number of reasons, discovery, access, evaluation and curation of grey literature pose a number of difficultiesGenerally, grey literature lacks any strict or meaningful bibliographic controlBasic information such as authors, publication dates and publishing or corporate bodies may not be easily identifiedSimilarly, the nonprofessional layouts and formats, low print runs and non-conventional channels of distribution make the organized collection of grey literature a challenge compared to journals and books.Although grey literature is often discussed with reference to scientific research, it is by no means restricted to any one field: outside the hard sciences, it presents significant challenges in archaeology where site surveys and excavation reports, containing unique data, have frequently been produced and circulated in informal ""grey"" formats",5
"Some of the problems of accessing grey literature have decreased since the late 1990s as government, professional, business and university bodies have increasingly published their reports and other official or review documents onlineThe informal nature of grey literature has meant that it has become more numerous as the technology that allows people to create documentation has improvedLess expensive and more sophisticated printers increased the ease of creating grey literatureAnd the ability to post documents on the internet has resulted in a tremendous boom",5
"The impact of this trend has been greatly boosted since the early 2000s, as the growth of major search engines has made retrieving grey literature simultaneously easier and more clutteredGrey reports are thus far more easily found online than they were, often at no cost to accessMost users of reports and other grey documents have migrated to using online copies, and efforts by libraries to collect hard-copy versions have generally declined in consequence",5
"However, many problems remain because originators often fail to produce online reports or publications to an adequate bibliographic standard (often omitting a publication date, for instance)Documents are often not assigned permanent URLs or DOI numbers, or stored in electronic depositories, so that link rot can develop within citations, reference lists, databases and websitesCopyright law and the copyrighted status of many reports inhibits their downloading and electronic storage and there is a lack of large scale collecting of digital grey literature",5
"Securing long-term access to and management of grey literature in the digital era thus remains a considerable problemThe amount of digital grey literature now available also poses a problem for finding relevant resources and to be able to assess their credibility and quality given the number of resources now availableAt the same time a great deal of grey literature remains hidden, either not made public or not made discoverable via search engines",5
"    Databases    Various databases and libraries collect and make available print and digital grey literature; however, the cost and difficulty of finding and cataloguing grey literature mean that it is still difficult to find large collectionsThe British Library began collecting print grey literature in the post-WWII period and now has an extensive collection of print resourcesAnalysis & Policy Observatory has an extensive collection of grey literature on a wide range of public policy issues, ArXiv is a collection of preprints on physics and other sciences, and RePEc is a collection of economics working papers",5
"Many university libraries provide subject guides that give information on grey literature and suggestions for databasesROAR and OpenDOAR are directories of open access institutional repositories and subject repositories, many of which contain some grey literatureSeveral academic search engines exist to combine the open data provided by such open archives through OAI-PMH, as well as records from publishers deposited in CrossRef and other sourcesThey include BASE, CORE and Unpaywall, which indexes over 20 million open access publications as of 2020",5
"    Resources and advocacy   The annual international grey literature conference series has been organized since 1993 by the Europe-based organization GreyNetResearch in this field of information has been systematically documented and archived via the International Conference on Grey Literature series.Greynet also produces a journal on grey literature and has been a key advocate for the recognition and study of grey literature, particularly in library and information sciences, The Grey JournalThe Grey Journal appears three times a year—in spring, summer, and autumn",5
"Each issue in a volume is thematic and deals with one or more related topics in the field of grey literatureThe Grey Journal appears both in print and electronic formatsThe electronic version on article level is available via EBSCO's LISTA-FT Database (EBSCO Publishing)The Grey Journal is indexed by Scopus and othersOn 16 May 2014, the Pisa Declaration on Policy Development for Grey Literature Resources was ratified and published",5
"The history of literature is the historical development of writings in prose or poetry that attempt to provide entertainment, enlightenment, or instruction to the reader/listener/observer, as well as the development of the literary techniques used in the communication of these piecesNot all writings constitute literatureSome recorded materials, such as compilations of data (e.g., a check register) are not considered literature, and this article relates only to the evolution of the works defined above",5
"    The start of literature    Literature and writing, though connected, are not synonymousThe very first writings from ancient Sumer by any reasonable definition do not constitute literature—the same is true of some of the early Egyptian hieroglyphics or the thousands of logs from ancient Chinese regimesScholars have often disagreed concerning when written record-keeping became more like ""literature"" than anything else; the definition is largely subjectiveMoreover, given the significance of distance as a cultural isolator in earlier centuries, the historical development of literature did not occur at an even pace across the world",5
"The problems of creating a uniform global history of literature are compounded by the fact that many texts have been lost over the millennia, either deliberately, by accident, or by the total disappearance of the originating cultureMuch has been written, for example, about the destruction of the Library of Alexandria in the 1st century BC, and the innumerable key texts which are believed to have been lost forever to the flames",5
"The deliberate suppression of texts (and often their authors) by organisations of either a spiritual or a temporal nature further shrouds the subject Certain primary texts, however, may be isolated which have a qualifying role as literature's first stirringsVery early examples include Epic of Gilgamesh, in its Sumerian version predating 2000 BC, and the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which was written down in the Papyrus of Ani in about 1250 BC, but probably dates from about the 18th century BC",5
"Ancient Egyptian literature was not included in early studies of the history of literature because the writings of Ancient Egypt were not translated into European languages until after the Rosetta stone was deciphered in the early 19th centuryHomer's Iliad and Odyssey date to the 8th century BC, and mark the beginning of Classical AntiquityThey also stand in an oral tradition that stretches back to the late Bronze Age    Antiquity       China    The Classic of Poetry (or Shijing) is the oldest existing collection of Chinese poetry, comprising 305 works by anonymous authors dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC",5
"The Chu Ci anthology (or Songs of Chu) is a volume of poems attributed to or considered to be inspired by Qu Yuan's verse writingQu Yuan is the first author of verse in China to have his name associated to his work and is also regarded as one of the most prominent figures of Romanticism in Chinese classical literatureThe first great author on military tactics and strategy was Sun Tzu, whose The Art of War remains on the shelves of many modern military officers (and its advice has been applied to the corporate world as well)",5
"Philosophy developed far differently in China from the way it did in Greece—rather than presenting extended dialogues, the Analects of Confucius and Lao Zi's Tao Te Ching presented sayings and proverbs more directly and didacticallyThe Zhuangzi is composed of a large collection of creative anecdotes, allegories, parables, and fables; a masterpiece of both philosophical and literary skill, it has significantly influenced writers and poets for more than 2000 years from the Han dynasty to the present",5
"Among the earliest Chinese works of narrative history, Zuo Zhuan is a gem of classical Chinese proseThis work and the Shiji or Records of the Grand Historian, were regarded as the ultimate models by many generations of prose stylists in ancient China    Hebrew, Phoenician and Aramaic literature    The Northwest Semitic languages are a language group that contains the Aramaic language, as well as the Canaanite languages including Phoenician and HebrewA corpus of Canaanite and Aramaic inscriptions (or ""Northwest Semitic inscriptions"") are the primary extra-Biblical source for the writings of the ancient Phoenicians, Hebrews and Arameans",5
"These inscriptions occur on stone slabs, pottery ostraca, ornaments, and range from simple names to full textsThe older inscriptions form a Canaanite–Aramaic dialect continuum, exemplified by writings which scholars have struggled to fit into either category, such as the Stele of Zakkur and the Deir Alla InscriptionThe books that constitute the Hebrew Bible developed over roughly a millenniumThe oldest texts seem to come from the eleventh or tenth centuries BCE, whilst most of the other texts are somewhat later",5
"They are edited works, being collections of various sources intricately and carefully woven togetherThe Old Testament was compiled and edited by various authors over a period of centuries, with many scholars concluding that the Hebrew canon was solidified by about the 3rd century BCThe works have been subject to various literary evaluations (both secular and religious)Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: “In the Jewish Old Testament, there are men, things and speeches in so grand a style that Greek and Indian literature have nothing to compare to it",5
"One stands with awe and reverence before these tremendous remnants of what man once was..The taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone of 'greatness' and 'smallness'.”     Classical antiquity        Greek literature     Ancient Greek society placed considerable emphasis upon literatureMany authors consider the western literary tradition to have begun with the epic poems The Iliad and The Odyssey, which remain giants in the literary canon for their skillful and vivid depictions of war and peace, honor and disgrace, love and hatred",5
"Notable among later Greek poets was Sappho, who defined, in many ways, lyric poetry as a genreA playwright named Aeschylus changed Western literature forever when he introduced the ideas of dialogue and interacting characters to playwritingIn doing so, he essentially invented ""drama"": his Oresteia trilogy of plays is seen as his crowning achievementOther refiners of playwriting were Sophocles and EuripidesSophocles is credited with skillfully developing irony as a literary technique, most famously in his play Oedipus Rex",5
"Euripedes, conversely, used plays to challenge societal norms and mores—a hallmark of much of Western literature for the next 2,300 years and beyond—and his works such as Medea, The Bacchae and The Trojan Women are still notable for their ability to challenge our perceptions of propriety, gender, and warAristophanes, a comic playwright, defines and shapes the idea of comedy almost as Aeschylus had shaped tragedy as an art form—Aristophanes' most famous plays include the Lysistrata and The Frogs",5
"Philosophy entered literature in the dialogues of Plato, who converted the give and take of Socratic questioning into written formAristotle, Plato's student, wrote dozens of works on many scientific disciplines, but his greatest contribution to literature was likely his Poetics, which lays out his understanding of drama, and thereby establishes the first criteria for literary criticismThe New Testament is an unusual collection of texts--John's Book of Revelation, though not the first of its kind, essentially defines apocalypse as a literary genre",5
"     Latin literature     In many respects, the writers of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire chose to avoid innovation in favor of imitating the great Greek authorsVirgil's Aeneid, in many ways, emulated Homer's Iliad; Plautus, a comic playwright, followed in the footsteps of Aristophanes; Tacitus' Annals and Germania follow essentially the same historical approaches that Thucydides devised (the Christian historian Eusebius does also, although far more influenced by his religion than either Tacitus or Thucydides had been by Greek and Roman polytheism); Ovid and his Metamorphoses explore the same Greek myths again in new ways",5
"It can be argued, and has been, that the Roman authors, far from being mindless copycats, improved on the genres already established by their Greek predecessorsFor example, Ovid's Metamorphoses creates a form which is a clear predecessor of the stream of consciousness genreWhat is undeniable is that the Romans, in comparison with the Greeks, innovate relatively few literary styles of their ownSatire is one of the few Roman additions to literature—Horace was the first to use satire extensively as a tool for argument, and Juvenal made it into a weapon",5
"Augustine of Hippo and his The City of God do for religious literature essentially what Plato had done for philosophy, but Augustine's approach was far less conversational and more didactiveHis Confessions is perhaps the first true autobiography, and it gave rise to the genre of confessional literature which is now more popular than ever    India    Knowledge traditions in India handed down philosophical gleanings and theological concepts through the two traditions of Shruti and Smriti, meaning that which is learnt and that which is experienced, which included the Vedas",5
"It is generally believed that the Puranas are the earliest philosophical writings in Indian history, although linguistic works on Sanskrit existed earlier than 1000 BCPuranic works such as the Indian epics: Ramayana and Mahabharata, have influenced countless other works, including Balinese Kecak and other performances such as shadow puppetry (wayang), and many European worksPali literature has an important position in the rise of BuddhismClassical Sanskrit literature flowers in the Maurya and Gupta periods, roughly spanning the 2nd century BC to the 8th century AD",5
"Classical Tamil literature also emerged in the early historic period dating from 300 BC to 300 AD, and is the earliest secular literature of India, mainly dealing with themes such as love and war    Middle Ages       Europe   After the fall of Rome (in roughly 476), many of the literary approaches and styles invented by the Greeks and Romans fell out of favor in EuropeIn the millennium or so that intervened between Rome's fall and the Florentine Renaissance, medieval literature focused more and more on faith and faith-related matters, in part because the works written by the Greeks had not been preserved in Europe, and therefore there were few models of classical literature to learn from and move beyond",5
"What little there was became changed and distorted, with new forms beginning to develop from the distortionsSome of these distorted beginnings of new styles can be seen in the literature generally described as Matter of Rome, Matter of France and Matter of BritainAlthough much had been lost to the ravages of time (and to catastrophe, as in the burning of the Library of Alexandria), many Greek works remained extant: they were preserved and copied carefully by Muslim scribes",5
"In Europe, hagiographies, or ""lives of the saints"", are frequent among early medieval textsThe writings of Bede—Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum—and others continue the faith-based historical tradition begun by Eusebius in the early 4th centuryPlaywriting essentially ceased, except for the mystery plays and the passion plays that focused heavily on conveying Christian belief to the common peopleAround 400 AD the Prudenti Psychomachia began the tradition of allegorical talesPoetry flourished, however, in the hands of the troubadours, whose courtly romances and chanson de geste amused and entertained the upper classes who were their patrons",5
"Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote works which he claimed were histories of BritainThese were highly fanciful and included stories of Merlin the magician and King ArthurEpic poetry continued to develop with the addition of the mythologies of Northern Europe: Beowulf and the Norse sagas have much in common with Homer and Virgil's approaches to war and honor, while poems such as Dante's Divine Comedy and Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales take much different stylistic directions",5
"In November 1095, Pope Urban II preached the First Crusade at the Council of ClermontThe crusades would affect everything in Europe and the Middle East for many years to come and literature would, along with everything else, be transformed by the wars between these two culturesFor instance the image of the knight would take on a different significanceAlso the Islamic emphasis on scientific investigation and the preservation of the Greek philosophical writings would eventually affect European literature",5
"Between Augustine and The Bible, religious authors had numerous aspects of Christianity that needed further explication and interpretationThomas Aquinas, more than any other single person, was able to turn theology into a kind of science, in part because he was heavily influenced by Aristotle, whose works were returning to Europe in the 13th century    Islamic world    The most well known fiction from the Islamic world was The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights), which was a compilation of many earlier folk tales told by the Persian Queen Scheherazade",5
"The epic took form in the 10th century and reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to anotherAll Arabian fantasy tales were often called ""Arabian Nights"" when translated into English, regardless of whether they appeared in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights, in any version, and a number of tales are known in Europe as ""Arabian Nights"" despite existing in no Arabic manuscript.This epic has been influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland",5
"Many imitations were written, especially in FranceVarious characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali BabaHowever, no medieval Arabic source has been traced for Aladdin, which was incorporated into The Book of One Thousand and One Nights by its French translator, Antoine Galland, who heard it from an Arab Syrian Christian storyteller from AleppoThe popularity of the work may in part be due to greater popular knowledge of history and geography since it was written",5
"This meant that the plausibility of great marvels had to be set at a greater distance of time (""long ago"") and place (""far away"")This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in fantasy fiction having little connection, if any, to actual times and placesA number of elements from Arabian mythology and Persian mythology are now common in modern fantasy, such as genies, bahamuts, magic carpets, magic lamps, etcWhen L",5
"Frank Baum proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements he felt the genie, dwarf and fairy were stereotypes to avoid A number of stories within the One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights) also feature science fiction elementsOne example is ""The Adventures of Bulukiya"", where the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to the Garden of Eden and to Jahannam, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of jinns, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life",5
"In another Arabian Nights tale, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater submarine society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not existOther Arabian Nights tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them",5
"""The City of Brass"" features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city""The Ebony Horse"" features a robot in the form of a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun, while the ""Third Qalandar's Tale"" also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman",5
"""The City of Brass"" and ""The Ebony Horse"" can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction.Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, considered the greatest epic of Italian literature, derived many features of and episodes about the hereafter directly or indirectly from Arabic works on Islamic eschatology: the Hadith and the Kitab al-Miraj (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly before as Liber Scale Machometi, ""The Book of Muhammad's Ladder"") concerning Muhammad's ascension to Heaven, and the spiritual writings of Ibn Arabi",5
"The Moors also had a noticeable influence on the works of George Peele and William ShakespeareSome of their works featured Moorish characters, such as Peele's The Battle of Alcazar and Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, Titus Andronicus and Othello, which featured a Moorish Othello as its title characterThese works are said to have been inspired by several Moorish delegations from Morocco to Elizabethan England at the beginning of the 17th century",5
"     Arabic literature     Ibn Tufail (Abubacer) and Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288) were pioneers of the philosophical novelIbn Tufail wrote the first fictional Arabic novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan (Philosophus Autodidactus) as a response to al-Ghazali's The Incoherence of the Philosophers, and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a novel Theologus Autodidactus as a response to Ibn Tufail's Philosophus AutodidactusBoth of these narratives had protagonists (Hayy in Philosophus Autodidactus and Kamil in Theologus Autodidactus) who were autodidactic feral children living in seclusion on a desert island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story",5
"However, while Hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story in Philosophus Autodidactus, the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in Theologus Autodidactus, developing into the earliest known coming of age plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel.Theologus Autodidactus deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation, futurology, the end of the world and doomsday, resurrection, and the afterlife",5
"Rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using the scientific knowledge of biology, astronomy, cosmology and geology known in his timeHis main purpose behind this science fiction work was to explain Islamic religious teachings in terms of science and philosophy through the use of fiction.A Latin translation of Ibn Tufail's work, Philosophus Autodidactus, first appeared in 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger, followed by an English translation by Simon Ockley in 1708, as well as German and Dutch translations",5
"These translations later inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe, a candidate for the title of ""first novel in English""Philosophus Autodidactus also inspired Robert Boyle to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, The Aspiring NaturalistThe story also anticipated Rousseau's Emile: or, On Education in some ways, and is also similar to Mowgli's story in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as well as Tarzan's story, in that a baby is abandoned but taken care of and fed by a mother wolf.Among other innovations in Arabic literature was Ibn Khaldun's perspective on chronicling past events—by fully rejecting supernatural explanations, Khaldun essentially invented the scientific or sociological approach to history",5
"     Persian literature     Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, is a mythical and heroic retelling of Persian historyIt is the longest epic poem ever writtenFrom Persian culture the book which would, eventually, become the most famous in the west is the Rubaiyat of Omar KhayyamThe Rubáiyát is a collection of poems by the Persian mathematician and astronomer Omar Khayyám (1048–1122)""Rubaiyat"" means ""quatrains"": verses of four linesAmir Arsalan was also a popular mythical Persian story, which has influenced some modern works of fantasy fiction, such as The Heroic Legend of Arslan",5
"Examples of early Persian proto-science fiction include Al-Farabi's Opinions of the residents of a splendid city about a utopian society, and elements such as the flying carpet     Ottoman literature     The two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and proseOf the two, divan poetry was by far the dominant streamUntil the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction; that is, there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European romance, short story, or novel (though analogous genres did, to some extent, exist in both the Turkish folk tradition and in divan poetry)",5
"Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose never managed to develop to the extent that contemporary divan poetry didA large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec' (سجع, also transliterated as seci), or rhymed prose, a type of writing descended from the Arabic saj' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a rhyme",5
"    Jewish literature    Medieval Jewish fiction often drew on ancient Jewish legends, and was written in a variety of languages including Hebrew and Judeo-ArabicLiturgical Jewish poetry in Hebrew flourished in Palestine in the seventh and eighth centuries with the writings of Yose ben Yose, Yanai, and Eleazar Kalir Later Jewish poets in Spain, Provencal, and Italy wrote both religious and secular poems in Hebrew; particularly prominent poets were the Spanish Jewish poets Solomon ibn Gabirol and Yehuda Halevi",5
"In addition to poetry and fiction, medieval Jewish literature also includes philosophical literature, mystical (Kabbalistic) literature, ethical (musar) literature, legal (halakhic) literature, and commentaries on the Bible    India    Early Medieval (Gupta period) literature in India sees the flowering of Sanskrit drama, classical Sanskrit poetry and the compilation of the PuranasSanskrit declines in the early 2nd millennium, late works such as the Kathasaritsagara dating to the 11th century, to the benefit of literature composed in Middle Indic vernaculars such as Old Bengali, Old Hindi",5
"    China    Lyric poetry advanced far more in China than in Europe prior to 1000, as multiple new forms developed in the Han, Tang, and Song dynasties: perhaps the greatest poets of this era in Chinese literature were Li Bai and Du FuPrinting began in Tang Dynasty ChinaA copy of the Diamond Sutra, a key Buddhist text, found sealed in a cave in China in the early 20th century, is the oldest known dated printed book, with a printed date of 868",5
"The method used was block printingThe scientist, statesman, and general Shen Kuo (1031–1095 AD) was the author of the Dream Pool Essays (1088), a large book of scientific literature that included the oldest description of the magnetized compassDuring the Song Dynasty, there was also the enormous historical work of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 294 volumes of 3 million written Chinese characters by the year 1084 ADThe true vernacular novel was developed in China during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD)",5
"Some commentators feel that China originated the novel form with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong (in the 14th century), although others feel that this epic is distinct from the novel in key waysFictional novels published during the Ming period include the Water Margin and the Journey to the West, which represent two of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature    Japan    Classical Japanese literature generally refers to literature produced during the Heian Period, what some would consider a golden era of art and literature",5
"The Tale of Genji (early 11th century) by Murasaki Shikibu is considered the pre-eminent masterpiece of Heian fiction and an early example of a work of fiction in the form of a novelIt is sometimes called the world's first novel, the first modern novel, the first romance novel, or the first novel to still be considered a classicOther important works of this period include the Kokin Wakashū (905), a waka-poetry anthology, and The Pillow Book (990s), the latter written by Murasaki Shikibu's contemporary and rival, Sei Shōnagon, as an essay about the life, loves, and pastimes of nobles in the Emperor's court",5
"The iroha poem, now one of two standard orderings for the Japanese syllabary, was also written during the early part of this periodThe 10th-century Japanese narrative, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, can be considered an early example of proto-science fictionThe protagonist of the story, Kaguya-hime, is a princess from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war, and is found and raised by a bamboo cutter in Japan",5
"She is later taken back to the Moon by her real extraterrestrial familyA manuscript illustration depicts a disc-shaped flying object similar to a flying saucer.In this time the imperial court patronized the poets, most of whom were courtiers or ladies-in-waitingEditing anthologies of poetry was a national pastimeReflecting the aristocratic atmosphere, the poetry was elegant and sophisticated and expressed emotions in a rhetorical style    Renaissance    Had nothing occurred to change literature in the 15th century but the Renaissance, the break with medieval approaches would have been clear enough",5
"The 15th century, however, also brought Johann Gutenberg and his invention of the printing press, an innovation (for Europe, at least) that would change literature foreverTexts were no longer precious and expensive to produce—they could be cheaply and rapidly put into the marketplaceLiteracy went from the prized possession of the select few to a much broader section of the population (though by no means universal)As a result, much about literature in Europe was radically altered in the two centuries following Gutenberg's unveiling of the printing press in 1455",5
William Caxton was the first English printer and published English language texts including Le Morte d'Arthur (a collection of oral tales of the Arthurian Knights which is a forerunner of the novel) and Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury TalesThese are an indication of future directions in literatureWith the arrival of the printing press a process begins in which folk yarns and legends are collected within a frame story and then mass published,5
"In the Renaissance, the focus on learning for learning's sake causes an outpouring of literaturePetrarch popularized the sonnet as a poetic form; Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron made romance acceptable in prose as well as poetry; François Rabelais rejuvenates satire with Gargantua and Pantagruel; Michel de Montaigne single-handedly invented the essay and used it to catalog his life and ideasPerhaps the most controversial and important work of the time period was a treatise printed in Nuremberg, entitled De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium: in it, the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus removed the Earth from its privileged position in the universe, which had far-reaching effects, not only in science, but in literature and its approach to humanity, hierarchy, and truth",5
"    Early modern period    A new spirit of science and investigation in Europe was part of a general upheaval in human understanding which began with the European discovery of the New World in 1492 and continues through the subsequent centuries, even up to the present dayThe form of writing now commonplace across the world—the novel—originated from the early modern period and grew in popularity in the next centuryBefore the modern novel became established as a form there first had to be a transitional stage when ""novelty"" began to appear in the style of the epic poem",5
"Plays for entertainment (as opposed to religious enlightenment) returned to Europe's stages in the early modern periodWilliam Shakespeare is the most notable of the early modern playwrights, but numerous others made important contributions, including Molière, Pierre Corneille, Jean Racine, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Lope de Vega, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben JonsonFrom the 16th to the 18th century Commedia dell'arte performers improvised in the streets of Italy and FranceSome Commedia dell'arte plays were written down",5
"Both the written plays and the improvisation were influential upon literature of the time, particularly upon the work of MolièreShakespeare drew upon the arts of jesters and strolling players in creating new style comediesAll the parts, even the female ones, were played by men (en travesti) but that would change, first in France and then in England too, by the end of the 17th centuryThe epic Elizabethan poem The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser was published, in its first part, in 1590 and then in completed form in 1597",5
"The Fairie Queen marks the transitional period in which ""novelty"" begins to enter into the narrative in the sense of overturning and playing with the flow of eventsTheatrical forms known in Spenser's time such as the Masque and the Mummers' Play are incorporated into the poem in ways which twist tradition and turn it to political propaganda in the service of Queen Elizabeth IThe earliest work considered an opera in the sense the work is usually understood dates from around 1597",5
"It is Dafne, (now lost) written by Jacopo Peri for an elite circle of literate Florentine humanists who gathered as the ""Camerata""The 17th century is considered the greatest era of literature both in Spain, where it is called the Spanish Golden Age (Siglo de Oro), and in France, where it is known as the  Grand Siècle (Great Century)The most famous French authors, beside playwrights, include Jean de La Fontaine and Charles Perrault known primarily for their fables",5
"Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote has been called ""the first novel"" by many literary scholars (or the first of the modern European novels)It was published in two partsThe first part was published in 1605 and the second in 1615It might be viewed as a parody of Le Morte d'Arthur (and other examples of the chivalric romance), in which case the novel form would be the direct result of poking fun at a collection of heroic folk legends",5
This is fully in keeping with the spirit of the age of enlightenment which began from about this time and delighted in giving a satirical twist to the stories and ideas of the pastIt's worth noting that this trend toward satirising previous writings was only made possible by the printing pressWithout the invention of mass-produced copies of a book it would not be possible to assume the reader will have seen the earlier work and will thus understand the references within the text,5
"The new style in English poetry during the 17th century was that of the metaphysical movementThe metaphysical poets were John Donne, George Herbert, Andrew Marvell and othersMetaphysical poetry is characterised by a spirit of intellectual investigation of the spiritual, rather than the mystical reverence of many earlier English poemsThe metaphysical poets were clearly trying to understand the world around them and the spirit behind it, instead of accepting dogma on the basis of faith",5
"In the middle of the century the king of England was overthrown and a republic declaredIn the new regime (which lasted from 1649 to 1653) the arts sufferedIn England and the rest of the British Isles Oliver Cromwell's rule temporarily banned all theatre, festivals, jesters, mummers plays and frivolitiesThe ban was lifted when the monarchy was restored with Charles IIThe Drury Lane theatre was favorite of King Charles",5
"In contrast to the metaphysical poets was John Milton's Paradise Lost, an epic religious poem in blank verseMilton had been Oliver Cromwell's chief propagandist and suffered when the Restoration cameParadise Lost is one of the highest developments of the epic form in poetry immediately preceding the era of the modern prose novelAn allegorical novel, The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come was published by John Bunyan in 1678",5
"Other early novelists include Daniel Defoe (born 1660) and Jonathan Swift (born 1667)    Modern period       18th century    This is the Age of Enlightenment and its most important authors are Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant and Adam SmithThe second half of the century sees the beginnings of Romanticism with Goethe    19th century    In Britain, the 19th century is dominated by the Victorian era, characterized by Romanticism, with Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth, Lord Byron or Samuel Taylor Coleridge and genres such as the gothic novel",5
"Charles Dickens, perhaps the most famous novelist in the history of English literature, was active during this time and contributed to the novel's emergence as the leading literary genre of Victorian EnglandIn Germany, the Sturm und Drang period of the late 18th century merges into a Classicist and Romantic period, epitomized by the long era of Goethe's activity, covering the first third of the centuryThe conservative Biedermeier style conflicts with the radical Vormärz in the turbulent period separating the end of the Napoleonic wars from the Revolutions of 1848",5
"In Denmark, the early 19th century Golden Age produced prolific literary authors such as Søren Kierkegaard and Hans Christian AndersenIn the later 19th century, Romanticism is countered by Realism and NaturalismThe late 19th century, known as the Belle Époque, with its Fin de siècle retrospectively appeared as a ""golden age"" of European culture, cut short by the outbreak of World War I in 1914    20th century    The main periods of 20th century literature are captured in the bipartite division, Modernist literature and Postmodern literature, flowering from roughly 1900 to 1940 and 1945 to 1980 respectively, divided, as a rule of thumb, by World War II",5
"Popular literature develops its own genres such as fantasy and science fictionIgnored by mainstream literary criticism, these genres develop their own establishments and critical awards, such as the Nebula Award (since 1965), the British Fantasy Award (since 1971) or the Mythopoeic Awards (since 1971)    History of the book    Related to other forms of literary history, the history of the book is a field of interdisciplinary enquiry drawing on the methods of bibliography, cultural history, literary criticism, and media theory",5
"Principally concerned with the production, circulation, and reception of texts and their material forms, book history seeks to connect forms of textuality with their material aspectsAmong the issues within the history of literature with which book history can be seen to intersect are: the development of authorship as a profession, the formation of reading audiences, the constraints of censorship and copyright, and the economics of literary form    See also       References       External links   The Literary Encyclopedia",5
"A literature review is an overview of the previously published works on a specific topicThe term can refer to a full scholarly paper or a section of a scholarly work such as a book, or an articleEither way, a literature review is supposed to provide the researcher/author and the audiences with a general image of the existing knowledge on the topic under questionA good literature review can ensure that a proper research question has been asked and a proper theoretical framework and/or research methodology have been chosen",5
"To be precise, a literature review serves to situate the current study within the body of the relevant literature and to provide context for the readerIn such case, the review usually precedes the methodology and results sections of the workProducing a literature review is often a part of graduate and post-graduate student work, including in the preparation of a thesis, dissertation, or a journal articleLiterature reviews are also common in a research proposal or prospectus (the document that is approved before a student formally begins a dissertation or thesis).A literature review can be a type of review article",5
" In this sense, a literature review is a scholarly paper that presents the current knowledge including substantive findings as well as theoretical and methodological contributions to a particular topicLiterature reviews are secondary sources and do not report new or original experimental work Most often associated with academic-oriented literature, such reviews are found in academic journals and are not to be confused with book reviews, which may also appear in the same publication",5
"Literature reviews are a basis for research in nearly every academic field    Types   The main types of literature reviews are: evaluative, exploratory, and instrumental.A fourth type, the systematic review, is often classified separately, but is essentially a literature review focused on a research question, trying to identify, appraise, select and synthesize all high-quality research evidence and arguments relevant to that questionA meta-analysis is typically a systematic review using statistical methods to effectively combine the data used on all selected studies to produce a more reliable result.Torraco (2016) describes an integrative literature review",5
"The purpose of an integrative literature review is to generate new knowledge on a topic through the process of review, critique, and then synthesis of the literature under investigation    Process and product   Shields and Rangarajan (2013) distinguish between the process of reviewing the literature and a finished work or product known as a literature review.: 193–229  The process of reviewing the literature is often ongoing and informs many aspects of the empirical research project",5

"Literature broadly is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetryIn recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribedLiterature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment, and  can also have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political roleLiterature, as an art form, can also include works in various non-fiction genres, such as biography, diaries, memoir, letters, and the essay",5
"Within its broad definition, literature includes non-fictional books, articles or other printed information on a particular subject.Etymologically, the term derives from Latin literatura/litteratura ""learning, a writing, grammar,"" originally ""writing formed with letters,"" from litera/littera ""letter""In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung textsDevelopments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, which now includes electronic literatureLiterature is classified according to whether it is poetry, prose or drama, and such works are categorized according to historical periods, or their adherence to certain aesthetic features, or genre",5
"    Definitions   Definitions of literature have varied over timeIn Western Europe, prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing literature can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions, so that cultural studies, for instance, include, in addition to canonical works, popular and minority genresThe word is also used in reference non-written works: to ""oral literature"" and ""the literature of preliterate culture""A value judgment definition of literature considers it as consisting solely of high quality writing that forms part of the belles-lettres (""fine writing"") tradition",5
"An example of this in the (1910–11) Encyclopædia Britannica that classified literature as ""the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing""    History       Oral literature   The use of the term ""literature"" here is a little problematic because of its origins in the Latin littera, “letter,” essentially writingAlternatives such as ""oral forms"" and ""oral genres"" have been suggested but the word literature is widely used.Oral literature is an ancient human tradition found in ""all corners of the world""",5
"Modern archaeology has been unveiling evidence of the human efforts to preserve and transmit arts and knowledge that depended completely or partially on an oral tradition, across various cultures:  The Judeo-Christian Bible reveals its oral traditional roots; medieval European manuscripts are penned by performing scribes; geometric vases from archaic Greece mirror Homer's oral style(...) Indeed, if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything, it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive, preliminary technology of communication we thought it to be",5
"Rather, if the whole truth is told, oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and, in many areas still, a contemporary realityThe earliest poetry is believed to have been recited or sung, employed as a way of remembering history, genealogy, and law.In Asia, the transmission of folklore, mythologies as well as scriptures in ancient India, in different Indian religions, was by oral tradition, preserved with precision with the help of elaborate mnemonic techniques.The early Buddhist texts are also generally believed to be of oral tradition, with the first by comparing inconsistencies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as the Greek, Serbia and other cultures, then noting that the Vedic literature is too consistent and vast to have been composed and transmitted orally across generations, without being written down",5
"According to Goody, the Vedic texts likely involved both a written and oral tradition, calling it a ""parallel products of a literate society"".Australian Aboriginal culture has thrived on oral traditions and oral histories passed down through thousands of yearsIn a study published in February 2020, new evidence showed that both Budj Bim and Tower Hill volcanoes erupted between 34,000 and 40,000 years agoSignificantly, this is a ""minimum age constraint for human presence in Victoria"", and also could be interpreted as evidence for the oral histories of the Gunditjmara people, an Aboriginal Australian people of south-western Victoria, which tell of volcanic eruptions being some of the oldest oral traditions in existence",5
"An axe found underneath volcanic ash in 1947 had already proven that humans inhabited the region before the eruption of Tower Hill.All ancient Greek literature was to some degree oral in nature, and the earliest literature was completely soHomer's epic poetry, states Michael Gagarin, was largely composed, performed and transmitted orallyAs folklores and legends were performed in front of distant audiences, the singers would substitute the names in the stories with local characters or rulers to give the stories a local flavor and thus connect with the audience, but making the historicity embedded in the oral tradition as unreliable",5
"The lack of surviving texts about the Greek and Roman religious traditions have led scholars to presume that these were ritualistic and transmitted as oral traditions, but some scholars disagree that the complex rituals in the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations were an exclusive product of an oral tradition.Writing systems are not known to have existed among Native North Americans before contact with EuropeansOral storytelling traditions flourished in a context without the use of writing to record and preserve history, scientific knowledge, and social practices",5
"While some stories were told for amusement and leisure, most functioned as practical lessons from tribal experience applied to immediate moral, social, psychological, and environmental issuesStories fuse fictional, supernatural, or otherwise exaggerated characters and circumstances with real emotions and morals as a means of teachingPlots often reflect real life situations and may be aimed at particular people known by the story's audienceIn this way, social pressure could be exerted without directly causing embarrassment or social exclusion",5

" Tim Parks has expressed skepticism that it is possible for ""Swedish professors ..[to] compar[e] a poet from Indonesia, perhaps translated into English with a novelist from Cameroon, perhaps available only in French, and another who writes in Afrikaans but is published in German and Dutch...""As of 2021, 16 of the 118 recipients have been of Scandinavian originThe Academy has often been alleged to be biased towards European, and in particular Swedish, authors.Nobel's ""vague"" wording for the criteria for the prize has led to recurrent controversy",5
"In the original Swedish, the word idealisk translates as  ""ideal""The Nobel Committee's interpretation has varied over the yearsIn recent years, this means a kind of idealism championing human rights on a broad scale    Controversies about Nobel laureate selections    From 1901 to 1912, the committee, headed by the conservative Carl David af Wirsén, weighed the literary quality of a work against its contribution towards humanity's struggle 'toward the ideal'Leo Tolstoy, Henrik Ibsen, Émile Zola, and Mark Twain were rejected in favor of authors little read today.The first prize in 1901, awarded to the French poet Sully Prudhomme, was heavily criticised",5
"Many believed that the acclaimed Russian author Tolstoy should have been awarded the first Nobel prize in literature.The choice of philosopher Rudolf Eucken as Nobel laureate in 1908 is widely considered to be one of the worst mistakes in the history of the Nobel Prize in LiteratureThe main candidates for the prize that year were poet Algernon Swinburne and author Selma Lagerlöf, but the Academy were divided between the candidates and, as a compromise, Eucken, representative of the Academy's interpretation of Nobel's ""ideal direction"", was launched as an alternative candidate that could be agreed upon.The choice of Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf as Nobel laureate in 1909 (for the ""lofty idealism, vivid imagination and spiritual perception that characterizes her writings"") followed fierce debate because of her writing style and subject matter, which broke literary decorums of the time.During World War I and its immediate aftermath, the committee adopted a policy of neutrality, favouring writers from non-combatant countries",5
"The pacifistic author Romain Rolland was awarded the prize for 1915Other years during the war Scandinavian writers were favoured, or the award was postponed.In 1931 the prize was awarded posthumously to the poet and former permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Erik Axel Karlfeldt, who had died earlier that yearThe prize was controversial not just because it was the first and only time the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded posthumously, but because the Academy had previously awarded two other Swedish writers of the same literary era, Selma Lagerlöf in 1909 and Verner von Heidenstam in 1916",5
"Internationally it was heavily criticised as few had heard of Karlfeldt.The Nobel Prize awarded to Pearl Buck in 1938 is one of the most criticised in the history of the prizeThe Academy awarded Buck ""for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China and for her biographical masterpieces"", referring to acclaimed and popular books published only a few years earlierBut her later work is generally not considered to be of the literary standard of a Nobel laureate.John Steinbeck received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature",5
"The selection was heavily criticised, and described as ""one of the Academy's biggest mistakes"" in one Swedish newspaperThe New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose ""limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising"", adding, ""we think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ..whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age"".In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, but he wrote declining it, stating that ""It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize laureate",5
"A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form."" Nevertheless he was awarded the prize.Soviet dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the 1970 prize laureate, did not attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm for fear that the USSR would prevent his return afterwards (his works there were circulated in samizdat—clandestine form)After the Swedish government refused to honor Solzhenitsyn with a public award ceremony and lecture at its Moscow embassy, Solzhenitsyn refused the award altogether, commenting that the conditions set by the Swedes (who preferred a private ceremony) were ""an insult to the Nobel Prize itself."" Solzhenitsyn did not accept the award and prize money until 10 December 1974, after he was deported from the Soviet Union",5
"Within the Swedish Academy, member Artur Lundkvist had argued that the Nobel Prize in Literature should not become a political prize and questioned the artistic value of Solzhenitsyn's work.In 1974, Graham Greene, Vladimir Nabokov, and Saul Bellow were believed to be likely candidates for the prize but the Academy decided on a joint award for Swedish authors Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson, both members of the Swedish Academy at the time, and unknown outside their home country",5
"Bellow received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976; neither Greene nor Nabokov was awarded it.The award to Italian performance artist Dario Fo in 1997 was initially considered ""rather lightweight"" by some critics, as he was seen primarily as a performer, and Catholic organizations saw the award to Fo as controversial as he had previously been censured by the Roman Catholic ChurchThe Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano expressed surprise at Fo's selection for the prize commenting that ""Giving the prize to someone who is also the author of questionable works is beyond all imagination."" Salman Rushdie and Arthur Miller had been strongly favoured to receive the prize, but the Nobel organisers were later quoted as saying that they would have been ""too predictable, too popular.""The award to Camilo José Cela was controversial as he had moved voluntarily from Madrid to Galicia during the Spanish Civil War in order to join Franco's rebel forces there as a volunteer; at the time of the Nobel ceremony in Stockholm in 1989, an article by Miguel Angel Villena, Between Fear and Impunity, which compiled commentaries by Spanish novelists on the noteworthy silence of the older generation of Spanish novelists on the Francoist pasts of public intellectuals, appeared below a photograph of Cela.A member of the Swedish Academy, Knut Ahnlund, who had not played an active role in the Academy since 1996, protested against the choice of the 2004 laureate, Elfriede Jelinek; Ahnlund resigned, alleging that selecting Jelinek had caused ""irreparable damage"" to the reputation of the award.The selection of Harold Pinter for the prize in 2005 was delayed for a couple of days, apparently due to Ahnlund's resignation, and led to renewed speculations about there being a ""political element"" in the Swedish Academy's awarding of the prize",5
"Although Pinter was unable to give his Nobel Lecture in person because of ill health, he delivered it from a television studio on video projected on screens to an audience at the Swedish Academy, in StockholmHis comments have been the source of much commentary and debateThe issue of their ""political stance"" was also raised in response to the awards of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Orhan Pamuk and Doris Lessing in 2006 and 2007, respectively.In recent years, the choices of Bob Dylan for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature and Peter Handke for the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature have been heavily criticised",5
"    Nationality-based criticism    The prize's focus on European men, and Swedes in particular, has been the subject of criticism, even from Swedish newspapersThe majority of laureates have been European, with Sweden itself receiving more prizes (8) than all of Asia (7, if Turkish Orhan Pamuk is included), as well as all of Latin America (7, if Saint Lucian Derek Walcott is included)In 2009, Horace Engdahl, then the permanent secretary of the Academy, declared that ""Europe still is the centre of the literary world"" and that ""the US is too isolated, too insular",5
"They don't translate enough and don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature.""In 2009, Engdahl's replacement, Peter Englund, rejected this sentiment (""In most language areas ..there are authors that really deserve and could get the Nobel Prize and that goes for the United States and the Americas, as well"") and acknowledged the Eurocentric nature of the award, saying that, ""I think that is a problemWe tend to relate more easily to literature written in Europe and in the European tradition."" American critics are known to object that those from their own country, like Philip Roth, Thomas Pynchon, and Cormac McCarthy, have been overlooked, as have Latin Americans such as Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, and Carlos Fuentes, while in their place Europeans lesser-known to that continent have triumphed",5
"The 2009 award to Herta Müller, previously little-known outside Germany but many times named favorite for the Nobel Prize, re-ignited the viewpoint that the Swedish Academy was biased and Eurocentric.The 2010 prize was awarded to Mario Vargas Llosa, a native of Peru in South America, a generally well-regarded decision When the 2011 prize was awarded to the Swedish poet Tomas Tranströmer, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Peter Englund said the prize was not decided based on politics, describing such a notion as ""literature for dummies""",5
"The Swedish Academy awarded the next two prizes to non-Europeans, Chinese author Mo Yan and Canadian short story writer Alice MunroFrench writer Patrick Modiano's win in 2014 renewed questions of Eurocentrism; when asked by The Wall Street Journal ""So no American this year, yet againWhy is that?"", Englund reminded Americans of the Canadian origins of the previous year's recipient, the Academy's desire for literary quality and the impossibility of rewarding everyone who deserves the prize",5
"    Overlooked literary achievements   In the history of the Nobel Prize in Literature, many critical literary figures were overlookedThe literary historian Kjell Espmark admitted that ""as to the early prizes, the censure of bad choices and blatant omissions is often justifiedTolstoy, Ibsen, and Henry James should have been rewarded instead of, for instance, Sully Prudhomme, Eucken, and Heyse""There are omissions which are beyond the control of the Nobel Committee such as the early death of an author as was the case with Marcel Proust, Italo Calvino, and Roberto Bolaño",5
"According to Kjell Espmark ""the main works of Kafka, Cavafy, and Pessoa were not published until after their deaths and the true dimensions of Mandelstam's poetry were revealed above all in the unpublished poems that his wife saved from extinction and gave to the world long after he had perished in his Siberian exile""British novelist Tim Parks ascribed the never-ending controversy surrounding the decisions of the Nobel Committee to the ""essential silliness of the prize and our own foolishness at taking it seriously"" and noted that ""eighteen (or sixteen) Swedish nationals will have a certain credibility when weighing up works of Swedish literature, but what group could ever really get its mind round the infinitely varied work of scores of different traditions",5
"And why should we ask them to do that?""Although several Scandinavians were awarded, two of the most celebrated writers, Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen and Swedish author August Strindberg were repeatedly bypassed by the committee, but Strindberg holds the singular distinction of being awarded an Anti-Nobel Prize, conferred by popular acclaim and national subscription and presented to him in 1912 by future prime minister Hjalmar Branting.Paul Valéry was nominated twelve times between 1930 and 1945, but died just as the Academy intended to award him the prize in 1945.James Joyce wrote the books that rank 1st and 3rd on the Modern Library 100 Best Novels – Ulysses and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man – but Joyce was never nominated for the prize",5
"Kjell Espmark, member of the Nobel Prize committee and author of the history of the prize, claimed that Joyce's ""stature was not properly recognized even in the English-speaking world"", but that Joyce doubtless would have been awarded if he had lived in the late 1940s when the Academy began to award literary pioneers like TSEliot.Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was nominated for the prize several times but the Academy did not award it to him, though he was among the final candidates some years in the 1960s.Graham Greene was nominated for the prize twenty times between the years 1950 and 1966",5
"Greene was a celebrated candidate to be awarded the prize in the 1960s and 1970s, and the Academy was criticised for passing him over.French novelist and intellectual André Malraux was seriously considered for the prize in the 1950sMalraux was competing with Albert Camus but was rejected several times, especially in 1954 and 1955, ""so long as he does not come back to novel""Thus, Camus was awarded the prize in 1957",5
"Malraux was again considered in 1969 when he was competing with Samuel Beckett for the prizeSome members of the Nobel committee supported a prize to Malraux, but Beckett was awarded.WHAuden was nominated to the Nobel Prize in Literature ten times in the 1960s and was among the final candidates for the prize several times, but the Academy favoured other writersIn 1964 Auden and Jean-Paul Sartre were the leading candidates, and the Academy favoured Sartre as Auden's best work was thought ""too far back in time""",5
"In 1967 Auden was one of three final candidates along with Graham Greene and the awarded Guatemalan author Miguel Ángel Asturias    Controversies about Swedish Academy board members   Membership in the 18-member academy, who select the recipients, is technically for lifeUntil 2018 members were not allowed to leave, although they might refuse to participateFor members who did not participate their board seat was left vacant until they diedTwelve active/participating members are required for a quorum.In 1989, three members, including the former permanent secretary Lars Gyllensten, resigned in protest after the academy refused to denounce Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for calling for the death of Salman Rushdie, author of The Satanic Verses",5
"A fourth member, Knut Ahnlund, decided to remain in the academy, but later refused to participate in their work and resigned in 2005 in protest to the Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Elfriede JelinekAccording to Ahnlund the decision to award Jelinek ruined the worth of the Nobel Prize in Literature for a long time     2018 controversy and award cancellation    In April 2018, three members of the academy board resigned in response to a sexual-misconduct investigation involving author Jean-Claude Arnault, who is married to board member Katarina Frostenson",5
"Arnault was accused by at least 18 women of sexual assault and harassmentHe and his wife were also accused of leaking the names of prize recipients on at least seven occasions so friends could profit from betsHe denied all accusations, although he was later convicted of rape and sentenced to two years and six months in prison Sara Danius, the board secretary, hired a law firm to investigate if Frostenson had leaked confidential information and if Arnault had any influence on the Academy, but no legal action was taken",5
"The investigation caused a split within the AcademyFollowing a vote to exclude board member Frostenson the three members resigned in protest over the decisions by the AcademyTwo former permanent secretaries, Sture Allén and Horace Engdahl, called Danius a weak leader.On 10 April, Danius was asked to resign from her position by the Academy, bringing the number of empty seats to fourAlthough the Academy voted against removing Katarina Frostenson from the committee, she voluntarily agreed to withdraw from participating in the academy, bringing the total of withdrawals to five",5
"Because two other seats were still vacant from the Rushdie affair, this left only 11 active members, one short of the quorum needed to vote in replacementsOn 4 May 2018, the Swedish Academy announced that the selection would be postponed until 2019, when two laureates would be chosenIt was still technically possible to choose a 2018 laureate, as only eight active members are required to choose a recipientHowever, there were concerns that the academy was not in any condition to credibly present the award",5
"The New Academy Prize in Literature was created as an alternative award for 2018 only.The scandal was widely seen as damaging to the credibility of the prize and its authorityAs noted by Andrew Brown in The Guardian in a lengthy deconstruction of the scandal:  ""The scandal has elements of a tragedy, in which people who set out to serve literature and culture discovered they were only pandering to writers and the people who hang around with them",5
"The pursuit of excellence in art was entangled with the pursuit of social prestigeThe academy behaved as if the meals in its clubhouse were as much an accomplishment as the work that got people elected there."" King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden said a reform of the rules may be evaluated, including the introduction of the right to resign in respect of the current lifelong membership of the committeeOn 5 March 2019, it was announced that the Nobel Prize in Literature would once again be awarded, and laureates for both 2018 and 2019 would be announced together",5
"The decision came after several changes were made to the structure of the Swedish Academy as well as to the Nobel Committee members selection, in order to ""[restore] trust in the Academy as a prize-awarding institution""    Similar international prizes   The Nobel Prize in Literature is not the only literary prize for which all nationalities are eligibleOther notable international literary prizes include the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the Franz Kafka Prize, the International Booker Prize when it was previously awarded for a writer's entire body of work, and in the 1960s the Formentor Prix International",5
"In contrast to the other prizes mentioned, the Neustadt International Prize is awarded bienniallyThe journalist Hephzibah Anderson has noted that the International Booker Prize ""is fast becoming the more significant award, appearing an ever more competent alternative to the Nobel""However since 2016 the International Booker Prize now recognizes an annual book of fiction translated into EnglishPrevious winners of the International Booker Prize who have gone on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature include Alice Munro and Olga Tokarczuk",5
"The Neustadt International Prize for Literature is regarded as one of the most prestigious international literary prizes, often referred to as the American equivalent to the Nobel PrizeLike the Nobel Prize, it is awarded not for any one work, but for an entire body of workIt is frequently seen as an indicator of who may be awarded the Nobel Prize in LiteratureGabriel García Márquez (1972 Neustadt, 1982 Nobel), Czesław Miłosz (1978 Neustadt, 1980 Nobel), Octavio Paz (1982 Neustadt, 1990 Nobel), Tomas Tranströmer (1990 Neustadt, 2011 Nobel) were first awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature before being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature",5
"Another award of note is the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award (formerly Prince of Asturias Award) in LettersDuring the first years of its existence it was almost exclusively awarded to writers in the Spanish language, but in more recent times writers in other languages have been awarded as wellWriters who have won both the Asturias Award in Letters and the Nobel Prize in Literature include Camilo José Cela, Günter Grass, Doris Lessing and Mario Vargas Llosa",5
"The America Award in Literature, which does not include a monetary prize, presents itself as an alternative to the Nobel Prize in LiteratureTo date, Peter Handke, Harold Pinter, José Saramago, and Mario Vargas Llosa are the only writers to have received both the America Award and the Nobel Prize in LiteratureThere are also prizes for honouring the lifetime achievement of writers in specific languages, like the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (for Spanish language, established in 1976) and the Camões Prize (for Portuguese language, established in 1989)",5
"Nobel laureates who were also awarded the Miguel de Cervantes Prize include Octavio Paz (1981 Cervantes, 1990 Nobel); Mario Vargas Llosa (1994 Cervantes, 2010 Nobel); and Camilo José Cela (1995 Cervantes, 1989 Nobel)José Saramago is the only author to receive both the Camões Prize (1995) and the Nobel Prize (1998) to dateThe Hans Christian Andersen Award is sometimes referred to as ""the Little Nobel""The award has earned this appellation since, in a similar manner to the Nobel Prize in Literature, it recognizes the lifetime achievement of writers, though the Andersen Award focuses on a single category of literary works (children's literature)",5

"Both processions meet at the churchyard, town plaza, or some other suitable area, where a girl, dressed as an angel, stands from a scaffold or descends on a rope and sings the Regina CaeliThe angel then removes the black veil to the sound of pealing bells and firecrackers, ending the penance and mourning of LentSenákulo – Essentially a Passion play, which depicts the passion and death of Jesus ChristIt is customarily performed during Holy Week, and bears similarities to Mystery plays popular in medieval Europe",5

"The early writings in English were characterized by melodrama, unreal language, and unsubtle emphasis on local colorThe literary content later imbibed themes that express the search for Filipino identity, reconciling the centuries-old Spanish and American influence to the Philippines' Asian heritageFor instance, Rafael Zulueta Da Costa's poem Like the Molave explored the challenges faced by the Philippines as a new country and, then, evaluated the past and present to discover what should constitute Filipino ideals",5

"Victorian literature refers to English literature during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837–1901)The 19th century is widely considered to be the Golden Age of English Literature, especially for British novelsIt was in the Victorian era that the novel became the leading literary genre in EnglishEnglish writing from this era reflects the major transformations in most aspects of English life, from scientific, economic, and technological advances to changes in class structures and the role of religion in society",5
"Famous novelists from this period include Charles Dickens, William Thackeray, the three Brontë sisters, George Eliot, and Thomas HardyWhile the Romantic period was a time of abstract expression and inward focus, essayists, poets, and novelists during the Victorian era began to reflect on realities of the day, including the dangers of factory work, the plight of the lower class, and the treatment of women and childrenProminent examples include poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and novelists Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy",5
Barrett's works on child labour cemented her success in a male-dominated world where women writers often had to use masculine pseudonymsDickens employed humour and an approachable tone while addressing social problems such as wealth disparityHardy used his novels to question religion and social structures.Poetry and theatre were also present during the Victorian eraRobert Browning and Alfred Tennyson were Victorian England's most famous poetsWith regard to the theatre it was not until the last decades of the 19th century that any significant works were produced,5
"Notable playwrights of the time include Gilbert and Sullivan, George Bernard Shaw, and Oscar Wilde    Prose fiction    Charles Dickens is the most famous Victorian novelistWith a focus on strong characterization, Dickens became extraordinarily popular in his day and remains one of the most popular and read authors of the worldHis first novel, The Pickwick Papers (1836–37) written when he was twenty-five, was an overnight success, and all his subsequent works sold extremely well",5
"The comedy of his first novel has a satirical edge and this pervades his writingWhile at the beginning of the 19th century most novels were published in three volumes, monthly serialization was revived with the publication of Charles Dickens' Pickwick Papers in twenty parts between April 1836 and November 1837Demand was high for each episode to introduce some new element, whether it was a plot twist or a new character, so as to maintain the readers' interest",5
"Dickens worked diligently and prolifically to produce the entertaining writing that the public wanted, but also to offer commentary on social problems and the plight of the poor and oppressedHis most important works include Oliver Twist (1837–39), Nicholas Nickleby (1838–39), A Christmas Carol (1843), Dombey and Son (1846–1848), David Copperfield (1849–50), Bleak House (1852–53), Little Dorrit (1855–1857), A Tale of Two Cities (1859), and Great Expectations (1860–61)There is a gradual trend in his fiction towards darker themes which mirrors a tendency in much of the writing of the 19th century",5
"William Thackeray was Dickens' great rival in the first half of Queen Victoria's reignWith a similar style but a slightly more detached, acerbic and barbed satirical view of his characters, he also tended to depict a more middle class society than Dickens didHe is best known for his novel Vanity Fair (1848), subtitled A Novel without a Hero, which is an example of a form popular in Victorian literature: a historical novel in which recent history is depicted",5
" Anne, Charlotte and Emily Brontë produced notable works of the period, although these were not immediately appreciated by Victorian criticsWuthering Heights (1847), Emily's only work, is an example of Gothic Romanticism from a woman's point of view, which examines class, myth, and genderJane Eyre (1847), by her sister Charlotte, is another major 19th century novel that has gothic themesAnne's second novel The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1848), written in realistic rather than romantic style, is mainly considered to be the first sustained feminist novel.Later in this period George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), published The Mill on the Floss in 1860, and in 1872 her most famous work Middlemarch",5
"Like the Brontës she published under a masculine pseudonymIn the later decades of the Victorian era Thomas Hardy was an important novelistHis most notable works include Under the Greenwood Tree (1872), Far from the Madding Crowd (1874), The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891), and Jude the Obscure (1895)Renowned for his cynical yet idyllic portrayal of pastoral life in the English countryside, Hardy's work pushed back against widespread urbanisation that came to symbolise the Victorian age",5
"Other significant novelists of this era were Elizabeth Gaskell (1810–1865), Anthony Trollope (1815–1882), George Meredith (1828–1909), and George Gissing (1857–1903)    Poetry    Robert Browning (1812–1889) and Alfred Tennyson (1809–1892) were notable poets in Victorian EnglandThomas Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life, but did not publish a collection until 1898The poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844–1889) was published posthumously in 1918Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) is also considered an important literary figure of the period, especially his poems and critical writings",5
"Early poetry of WBYeats was also published in Victoria's reignIt was not until the last decades of the 19th century that any significant theatrical works were produced, beginning with Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas of the 1870s, George Bernard Shaw's (1856–1950) plays of the 1890s, and Oscar Wilde's (1854–1900) The Importance of Being EarnestElizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning conducted their love affair through verse and produced many tender and passionate poems",5
"Both Matthew Arnold and Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote poems which sit somewhere in between the exultation of nature of the romantic Poetry and the Georgian Poetry of the early 20th centuryHowever Hopkins's poetry was not published until 1918Arnold's works anticipate some of the themes of these later poets, while Hopkins drew inspiration from verse forms of Old English poetry such as BeowulfThe reclaiming of the past was a major part of Victorian literature with an interest in both classical literature but also the medieval literature of England",5
"This movement can be traced back to Letitia Elizabeth Landon, especially her poetry collections, such as  The Troubadourand  The Golden Violet with its Tales of Romance and Chivalry.The Victorians loved the heroic, chivalrous stories of knights of old and they hoped to regain some of that noble, courtly behaviour and impress it upon the people both at home and in the wider empireThe best example of this is Alfred Tennyson's Idylls of the King, which blended the stories of King Arthur, particularly those by Thomas Malory, with contemporary concerns and ideas",5
"The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood also drew on myth and folklore for their art, with Dante Gabriel Rossetti contemporaneously regarded as the chief poet amongst them, although his sister Christina is now held by scholars to be a stronger poet    Drama   In drama, farces, musical burlesques, extravaganzas and comic operas competed with Shakespeare productions and serious drama by the likes of James Planché and Thomas William RobertsonIn 1855, the German Reed Entertainments began a process of elevating the level of (formerly risqué) musical theatre in Britain that culminated in the famous series of comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan and were followed by the 1890s with the first Edwardian musical comedies",5
"The first play to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the London comedy Our Boys by HJByron, opening in 1875Its astonishing new record of 1,362 performances was bested in 1892 by Charley's Aunt by Brandon ThomasAfter WSGilbert, Oscar Wilde became the leading poet and dramatist of the late Victorian periodWilde's plays, in particular, stand apart from the many now forgotten plays of Victorian times and have a closer relationship to those of the Edwardian dramatists such as George Bernard Shaw, whose career began in the 1890s",5
"Wilde's 1895 comic masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest, was the greatest of the plays in which he held an ironic mirror to the aristocracy while displaying virtuosic mastery of wit and paradoxical wisdomIt has remained extremely popular    Children's literature   The Victorians are credited with ""inventing childhood"", partly via their efforts to stop child labour and the introduction of compulsory educationAs children began to be able to read, literature for young people became a growth industry, with not only established writers producing works for children (such as Dickens' A Child's History of England) but also a new group of dedicated children's authors",5
"Writers like Lewis Carroll (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland), Anna Sewell (Black Beauty), and RMBallantyne (The Coral Island) wrote mainly for children, although they had an adult followingOther authors such as Robert Louis Stevenson (Treasure Island) and Anthony Hope (The Prisoner of Zenda) wrote mainly for adults, but their adventure novels are now generally classified as for childrenOther genres include nonsense verse, poetry which required a childlike interest (e.g",5
"Lewis Carroll's ""Jabberwocky"")School stories flourished: Thomas Hughes' Tom Brown's Schooldays and Kipling's Stalky & Coare classicsRarely were these publications designed to capture a child’s pleasure; however, with the increase in use of illustrations, children began to enjoy literature, and were able to learn morals in a more entertaining wayWith the newfound acceptance of reading for pleasure, fairy tales and folk tales became popularCompiling folk tales by many authors with different topics made it possible for children to read literature about many topics which interested them",5
"There were different types of books and magazines written for boys and girlsGirls' stories tended to be domestic and to focus on family life, whereas boys' stories were more about adventures    Science, philosophy and discovery    The Victorian era was an important time for the development of science and the Victorians had a mission to describe and classify the entire natural worldMuch of this writing does not rise to the level of being regarded as literature but one book in particular, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, remains famous",5
"The theory of evolution contained within the work challenged many of the ideas the Victorians had about themselves and their place in the worldAlthough it took a long time to be widely accepted, it would dramatically change subsequent thought and literatureMuch of the work of popularizing Darwin's theories was done by his younger contemporary Thomas Henry Huxley, who wrote widely on the subjectA number of other non-fiction works of the era made their mark on the literature of the period",5
"The philosophical writings of John Stuart Mill covered logic, economics, liberty and utilitarianismThe large and influential histories of Thomas Carlyle: The French Revolution, A History and On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History permeated political thought at the timeThe writings of Thomas Babington Macaulay on English history helped codify the Whig narrative that dominated the historiography for many yearsJohn Ruskin wrote a number of highly influential works on art and the history of art and championed such contemporary figures as J",5
"MWTurner and the Pre-RaphaelitesThe religious writer John Henry Newman's Oxford Movement aroused intense debate within the Church of England, exacerbated by Newman's own conversion to Catholicism, which he wrote about in his autobiography Apologia Pro Vita SuaA number of monumental reference works were published in this era, most notably the Oxford English Dictionary which would eventually become the most important historical dictionary of the English languageAlso published during the later Victorian era were the Dictionary of National Biography and the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica",5
"    Nature writing    In the United States, Henry David Thoreau's works and Susan Fenimore Cooper's Rural Hours (1850) were canonical influences on Victorian nature writingIn the UK, Philip Gosse and Sarah Bowdich Lee were two of the most popular nature writers in the early part of the Victorian eraThe Illustrated London News, founded in 1842, was the world's first illustrated weekly newspaper and often published articles and illustrations dealing with nature; in the second half of the 19th century, books, articles, and illustrations on nature became widespread and popular among an increasingly urbanized reading public",5
"    Supernatural and fantastic literature   The old Gothic tales that came out of the late 19th century are the first examples of the genre of fantastic fictionThese tales often centred on larger-than-life characters such as Sherlock Holmes, famous detective of the times, Sexton Blake, and other fictional characters of the era, such as Dracula, Edward Hyde, The Invisible Man, and many other fictional characters who often had exotic enemies to foilSpanning the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a particular type of story-writing known as gothic",5
"Gothic literature combines romance and horror in attempt to thrill and terrify the readerPossible features in a gothic novel are foreign monsters, ghosts, curses, hidden rooms and witchcraftGothic tales usually take place in locations such as castles, monasteries, and cemeteries, although the gothic monsters sometimes cross over into the real world, making appearances in cities such as London    The influence of Victorian literature    Writers from the United States and the British colonies of Australia, New Zealand and Canada were influenced by the literature of Britain and are often classed as a part of Victorian literature, although they were gradually developing their own distinctive voices",5
"Victorian writers of Canadian literature include Grant Allen, Susanna Moodie and Catherine Parr TraillAustralian literature has the poets Adam Lindsay Gordon and Banjo Paterson, who wrote Waltzing Matilda, and New Zealand literature includes Thomas Bracken and Frederick Edward ManingFrom the sphere of literature of the United States during this time are some of the country's greats including: Emily Dickinson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., Henry James, Herman Melville, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry David Thoreau, Mark Twain and Walt Whitman",5
" The problem with the classification of ""Victorian literature"" is the great difference between the early works of the period and the later works which had more in common with the writers of the Edwardian period and many writers straddle this dividePeople such as Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling, HGWells, Bram Stoker, HRider Haggard, Jerome KJerome and Joseph Conrad all wrote some of their important works during Victoria's reign but the sensibility of their writing is frequently regarded as Edwardian",5

"World literature is used to refer to the total of the world's national literature and the circulation of works into the wider world beyond their country of originIn the past, it primarily referred to the masterpieces of Western European literature; however, world literature today is increasingly seen in an international contextNow, readers have access to a wide range of global works in various translationsMany scholars assert that what makes a work considered world literature is its circulation beyond its country of origin",5
"For example, Damrosch states, ""A work enters into world literature by a double process: first, by being read as literature; second, by circulating out into a broader world beyond its linguistic and cultural point of origin""Likewise, the world literature scholar Venkat Mani believes that the ""worlding"" of literature is brought about by ""information transfer"" largely generated by developments in print cultureBecause of the advent of the library, ""Publishers and booksellers who print and sell affordable books, literate citizens who acquire these books, and public libraries that make these books available to those who cannot afford to buy them collectively play a very important role in the ""making"" of world literature""",5
"    History   Johann Wolfgang Goethe used the concept of Weltliteratur in several of his essays in the early decades of the nineteenth century to describe the international circulation and reception of literary works in Europe, including works of non-Western originThe concept achieved wide currency after his disciple Johann Peter Eckermann published a collection of conversations with Goethe in 1835Goethe spoke with Eckermann about the excitement of reading Chinese novels and Persian and Serbian poetry as well as of his fascination with seeing how his own works were translated and discussed abroad, especially in France",5
"He made a famous statement in January 1827, predicting that world literature would replace the national literature as the major mode of literary creativity in the future:  I am more and more convinced that poetry is the universal possession of mankind, revealing itself everywhere and at all times in hundreds and hundreds of men..I therefore like to look about me in foreign nations, and advise everyone to do the same",5
" National literature is now a rather unmeaning term; the epoch of world literature is at hand, and everyone must strive to hasten its approachReflecting a fundamentally economic understanding of world literature as a process of trade and exchange, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels used the term in their Communist Manifesto (1848) to describe the ""cosmopolitan character"" of bourgeois literary production, asserting that:  In place of the old wants, satisfied by the productions of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climates",5
"..And as in material, so also in intellectual productionThe intellectual creations of individual nations become common propertyNational one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literatureMartin Puchner has stated that Goethe had a keen sense of world literature as driven by a new world market in literatureThis market-based approach was sought by Marx and Engels in 1848 through their Manifesto document, which was published in four languages and distributed among several European countries, and has since become one of the most influential texts of the twentieth century",5
"While Marx and Engels followed Goethe in viewing world literature as a modern or future phenomenon, in 1886 the Irish scholar HMPosnett argued that world literature first arose in ancient empires, such as the Roman Empire, long before the rise of the modern national literatureToday, world literature is understood to encompass classical works from all periods, including contemporary literature that is written for a global audienceIn the postwar era, the study of comparative and world literature was revived in the United States",5
"Comparative literature was seen at the graduate level while world literature was taught as a first-year general education classThe focus remained largely on the Greek and Roman classics and the literature of major, modern Western-European powers, but a combination of factors in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to greater access to the worldThe end of the Cold War, the growing globalization of the world economy, and new waves of immigration led to several efforts to expand the study of world literature",5
"This change is illustrated by the expansion of The Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces, whose first edition in 1956 featured only Western-European and North American works, to a new ""expanded edition"" in 1995 with non-Western selectionsMajor survey anthologies today, including those published by Longman, Bedford and Norton, showcase several hundred authors from dozens of countries    Contemporary understandings   The explosive growth in the range of cultures studied under the rubric of world literature has inspired a variety of theoretical attempts to define the field and to propose effective modes of research and teaching",5
"In his 2003 book What Is World Literature? David Damrosch understands world literature to be less of a vast collection of works and more a matter of circulation and receptionHe proposed that works that thrive as world literature are ones that work well and even gain meaning through translationWhereas Damrosch's approach remains tied to the close reading of individual works, a different view was taken by the Stanford critic Franco Moretti in a pair of articles offering ""Conjectures on World Literature""",5
"Moretti believes that the scale of world literature exceeds what can be grasped by traditional methods of close reading, and advocates instead a mode of ""distant reading"" that would look at large-scale patterns as discerned from publication records and national literary historiesMoretti's approach combined elements of evolutionary theory with the world-systems analysis pioneered by Immanuel Wallerstein, an approach further discussed since then by Emily Apter in her influential book The Translation Zone",5
"Related to their world-systems approach is the work of French critic Pascale Casanova, La République mondiale des lettres (1999)Drawing on the theories of cultural production developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, Casanova explores the ways in which the works of peripheral writers must circulate into metropolitan centers in order to achieve recognition as being world literatureThe field of world literature continues to generate debate, with critics such as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak arguing that too often the study of world literature in translation smooths out both the linguistic richness of the original and the political force a work can have in its original context",5
"Other scholars, on the contrary, emphasize that world literature can and should be studied with close attention to original languages and contexts, even as works take on new dimensions and new meanings abroadWorld literature series are now being published in China and in Estonia, and a new Institute for World Literature, offering month-long summer sessions on theory and pedagogy, had its inaugural session at Peking University in 2011, with its next sessions at Istanbul Bilgi University in 2012 and at Harvard University in 2013",5

"The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who have made the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physicsIt is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901, the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine",6
"Physics is traditionally the first award presented in the Nobel Prize ceremonyThe first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to physicist Wilhelm Röntgen in recognition of the extraordinary services he rendered by the discovery of X-raysThis award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and is widely regarded as the most prestigious award that a scientist can receive in physicsIt is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death",6
"As of 2021 a total of 219 individuals have been awarded the prize    Background   Alfred Nobel, in his last will and testament, stated that his wealth should be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the ""greatest benefit on mankind"" in the fields of physics, chemistry, peace, physiology or medicine, and literatureThough Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last one was written a year before he died and was signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895",6
"Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million Swedish kronor (US$198 million, €176 million in 2016), to establish and endow the five Nobel PrizesOwing to the level of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting (Norwegian Parliament)The executors of his will were Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the prizes",6
"The members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approvedThe other prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 JuneThe Nobel Foundation then established guidelines for awarding the prizesIn 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II",6

"During the first stage that begins in September, a group of about 3,000 selected university professors, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, and others are sent confidential nomination formsThe completed forms must arrive at the Nobel Committee by 31 January of the following yearThe nominees are scrutinized and discussed by experts and are narrowed to approximately fifteen namesThe committee submits a report with recommendations on the final candidates to the Academy, where, in the Physics Class, it is further discussed",6
"The Academy then makes the final selection of the Laureates in Physics by a majority vote.The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the PrizeNomination records are sealed for fifty yearsWhile posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can be made if the individual died in the months between the decision of the committee (typically in October) and the ceremony in December",6
"Prior to 1974, posthumous awards were permitted if the candidate had died after being nominated.The rules for the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the significance of achievements being recognized has been ""tested by time""In practice, that means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longerFor example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s",6

"The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design of the Goddess of Nature, whose veil is held up by the Genius of ScienceThese medals, along with those for Physiology/Medicine and Literature, were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902    Diplomas    Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of SwedenEach diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate who receives it",6
"The diploma contains a picture with the name of the laureate and normally a citation explaining their accomplishments    Award money   At the awards ceremony, the laureate is given a document indicating the award sumThe amount of the cash award may differ from year to year, based on the funding available from the Nobel FoundationFor example, in 2009 the total cash awarded was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million), but in 2012 following the Great Recession, the amount was 8 million Swedish Kronor, or US$1.1 million",6

"Nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies atomic nuclei and their constituents and interactions, in addition to the study of other forms of nuclear matterNuclear physics should not be confused with atomic physics, which studies the atom as a whole, including its electronsDiscoveries in nuclear physics have led to applications in many fieldsThis includes nuclear power, nuclear weapons, nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging, industrial and agricultural isotopes, ion implantation in materials engineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology",6
"Such applications are studied in the field of nuclear engineeringParticle physics evolved out of nuclear physics and the two fields are typically taught in close associationNuclear astrophysics, the application of nuclear physics to astrophysics, is crucial in explaining the inner workings of stars and the origin of the chemical elements    History    The history of nuclear physics as a discipline distinct from atomic physics starts with the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896, made while investigating phosphorescence in uranium salts",6
"The discovery of the electron by JJThomson a year later was an indication that the atom had internal structureAt the beginning of the 20th century the accepted model of the atom was JJThomson's ""plum pudding"" model in which the atom was a positively charged ball with smaller negatively charged electrons embedded inside itIn the years that followed, radioactivity was extensively investigated, notably by Marie Curie, Pierre Curie, Ernest Rutherford and others",6
"By the turn of the century, physicists had also discovered three types of radiation emanating from atoms, which they named alpha, beta, and gamma radiationExperiments by Otto Hahn in 1911 and by James Chadwick in 1914 discovered that the beta decay spectrum was continuous rather than discreteThat is, electrons were ejected from the atom with a continuous range of energies, rather than the discrete amounts of energy that were observed in gamma and alpha decays",6
"This was a problem for nuclear physics at the time, because it seemed to indicate that energy was not conserved in these decaysThe 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded jointly to Becquerel, for his discovery and to Marie and Pierre Curie for their subsequent research into radioactivityRutherford was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 for his ""investigations into the disintegration of the elements and the chemistry of radioactive substances""",6
"In 1905, Albert Einstein formulated the idea of mass–energy equivalenceWhile the work on radioactivity by Becquerel and Marie Curie predates this, an explanation of the source of the energy of radioactivity would have to wait for the discovery that the nucleus itself was composed of smaller constituents, the nucleons    Rutherford discovers the nucleus   In 1906, Ernest Rutherford published ""Retardation of the α Particle from Radium in passing through matter."" Hans Geiger expanded on this work in a communication to the Royal Society with experiments he and Rutherford had done, passing alpha particles through air, aluminum foil and gold leaf",6
"More work was published in 1909 by Geiger and Ernest Marsden, and further greatly expanded work was published in 1910 by GeigerIn 1911–1912 Rutherford went before the Royal Society to explain the experiments and propound the new theory of the atomic nucleus as we now understand itPublished in 1909, with the eventual classical analysis by Rutherford published May 1911, the key preemptive experiment was performed during 1909, at the University of Manchester",6
"Ernest Rutherford's assistant, Professor  Johannes  ""Hans"" Geiger, and an undergraduate, Marsden, performed an experiment in which Geiger and Marsden under Rutherford's supervision fired alpha particles (helium 4 nuclei) at a thin film of gold foilThe plum pudding model had predicted that the alpha particles should come out of the foil with their trajectories being at most slightly bentBut Rutherford instructed his team to look for something that shocked him to observe: a few particles were scattered through large angles, even completely backwards in some cases",6
"He likened it to firing a bullet at tissue paper and having it bounce offThe discovery, with Rutherford's analysis of the data in 1911, led to the Rutherford model of the atom, in which the atom had a very small, very dense nucleus containing most of its mass, and consisting of heavy positively charged particles with embedded electrons in order to balance out the charge (since the neutron was unknown)As an example, in this model (which is not the modern one) nitrogen-14 consisted of a nucleus with 14 protons and 7 electrons (21 total particles) and the nucleus was surrounded by 7 more orbiting electrons",6
"    Eddington and stellar nuclear fusion   Around 1920, Arthur Eddington anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper The Internal Constitution of the StarsAt that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation E   mc2This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of hydrogen (see metallicity), had not yet been discovered",6
"    Studies of nuclear spin   The Rutherford model worked quite well until studies of nuclear spin were carried out by Franco Rasetti at the California Institute of Technology in 1929By 1925 it was known that protons and electrons each had a spin of ±+1⁄2In the Rutherford model of nitrogen-14, 20 of the total 21 nuclear particles should have paired up to cancel each other's spin, and the final odd particle should have left the nucleus with a net spin of 1⁄2",6
"Rasetti discovered, however, that nitrogen-14 had a spin of 1    James Chadwick discovers the neutron    In 1932 Chadwick realized that radiation that had been observed by Walther Bothe, Herbert Becker, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie was actually due to a neutral particle of about the same mass as the proton, that he called the neutron (following a suggestion from Rutherford about the need for such a particle)In the same year Dmitri Ivanenko suggested that there were no electrons in the nucleus — only protons and neutrons — and that neutrons were spin 1⁄2 particles, which explained the mass not due to protons",6
"The neutron spin immediately solved the problem of the spin of nitrogen-14, as the one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron in this model each contributed a spin of 1⁄2 in the same direction, giving a final total spin of 1With the discovery of the neutron, scientists could at last calculate what fraction of binding energy each nucleus had, by comparing the nuclear mass with that of the protons and neutrons which composed it",6
"Differences between nuclear masses were calculated in this wayWhen nuclear reactions were measured, these were found to agree with Einstein's calculation of the equivalence of mass and energy to within 1% as of 1934    Proca's equations of the massive vector boson field   Alexandru Proca was the first to develop and report the massive vector boson field equations and a theory of the mesonic field of nuclear forcesProca's equations were known to Wolfgang Pauli who mentioned the equations in his Nobel address, and they were also known to Yukawa, Wentzel, Taketani, Sakata, Kemmer, Heitler, and Fröhlich who appreciated the content of Proca's equations for developing a theory of the atomic nuclei in Nuclear Physics",6
"    Yukawa's meson postulated to bind nuclei   In 1935 Hideki Yukawa proposed the first significant theory of the strong force to explain how the nucleus holds togetherIn the Yukawa interaction a virtual particle, later called a meson, mediated a force between all nucleons, including protons and neutronsThis force explained why nuclei did not disintegrate under the influence of proton repulsion, and it also gave an explanation of why the attractive strong force had a more limited range than the electromagnetic repulsion between protons",6
"Later, the discovery of the pi meson showed it to have the properties of Yukawa's particleWith Yukawa's papers, the modern model of the atom was completeThe center of the atom contains a tight ball of neutrons and protons, which is held together by the strong nuclear force, unless it is too largeUnstable nuclei may undergo alpha decay, in which they emit an energetic helium nucleus, or beta decay, in which they eject an electron (or positron)",6
"After one of these decays the resultant nucleus may be left in an excited state, and in this case it decays to its ground state by emitting high-energy photons (gamma decay)The study of the strong and weak nuclear forces (the latter explained by Enrico Fermi via Fermi's interaction in 1934) led physicists to collide nuclei and electrons at ever higher energiesThis research became the science of particle physics, the crown jewel of which is the standard model of particle physics, which describes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces",6
"    Modern nuclear physics    A heavy nucleus can contain hundreds of nucleonsThis means that with some approximation it can be treated as a classical system, rather than a quantum-mechanical oneIn the resulting liquid-drop model, the nucleus has an energy that arises partly from surface tension and partly from electrical repulsion of the protonsThe liquid-drop model is able to reproduce many features of nuclei, including the general trend of binding energy with respect to mass number, as well as the phenomenon of nuclear fission",6
"Superimposed on this classical picture, however, are quantum-mechanical effects, which can be described using the nuclear shell model, developed in large part by Maria Goeppert Mayer and JHans DJensenNuclei with certain ""magic"" numbers of neutrons and protons are particularly stable, because their shells are filledOther more complicated models for the nucleus have also been proposed, such as the interacting boson model, in which pairs of neutrons and protons interact as bosons",6
"Ab initio methods try to solve the nuclear many-body problem from the ground up, starting from the nucleons and their interactions.Much of current research in nuclear physics relates to the study of nuclei under extreme conditions such as high spin and excitation energyNuclei may also have extreme shapes (similar to that of Rugby balls or even pears) or extreme neutron-to-proton ratiosExperimenters can create such nuclei using artificially induced fusion or nucleon transfer reactions, employing ion beams from an accelerator",6
"Beams with even higher energies can be used to create nuclei at very high temperatures, and there are signs that these experiments have produced a phase transition from normal nuclear matter to a new state, the quark–gluon plasma, in which the quarks mingle with one another, rather than being segregated in triplets as they are in neutrons and protons    Nuclear decay    Eighty elements have at least one stable isotope which is never observed to decay, amounting to a total of about 252 stable nuclides",6
"However, thousands of isotopes have been characterized as unstableThese ""radioisotopes"" decay over time scales ranging from fractions of a second to trillions of yearsPlotted on a chart as a function of atomic and neutron numbers, the binding energy of the nuclides forms what is known as the valley of stabilityStable nuclides lie along the bottom of this energy valley, while increasingly unstable nuclides lie up the valley walls, that is, have weaker binding energy",6
"The most stable nuclei fall within certain ranges or balances of composition of neutrons and protons: too few or too many neutrons (in relation to the number of protons) will cause it to decayFor example, in beta decay, a nitrogen-16 atom (7 protons, 9 neutrons) is converted to an oxygen-16 atom (8 protons, 8 neutrons) within a few seconds of being createdIn this decay a neutron in the nitrogen nucleus is converted by the weak interaction into a proton, an electron and an antineutrino",6
"The element is transmuted to another element, with a different number of protonsIn alpha decay, which typically occurs in the heaviest nuclei, the radioactive element decays by emitting a helium nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons), giving another element, plus helium-4In many cases this process continues through several steps of this kind, including other types of decays (usually beta decay) until a stable element is formedIn gamma decay, a nucleus decays from an excited state into a lower energy state, by emitting a gamma ray",6
"The element is not changed to another element in the process (no nuclear transmutation is involved)Other more exotic decays are possible (see the first main article)For example, in internal conversion decay, the energy from an excited nucleus may eject one of the inner orbital electrons from the atom, in a process which produces high speed electrons but is not beta decay and (unlike beta decay) does not transmute one element to another",6
"    Nuclear fusion   In nuclear fusion, two low-mass nuclei come into very close contact with each other so that the strong force fuses themIt requires a large amount of energy for the strong or nuclear forces to overcome the electrical repulsion between the nuclei in order to fuse them; therefore nuclear fusion can only take place at very high temperatures or high pressuresWhen nuclei fuse, a very large amount of energy is released and the combined nucleus assumes a lower energy level",6
"The binding energy per nucleon increases with mass number up to nickel-62Stars like the Sun are powered by the fusion of four protons into a helium nucleus, two positrons, and two neutrinosThe uncontrolled fusion of hydrogen into helium is known as thermonuclear runawayA frontier in current research at various institutions, for example the Joint European Torus (JET) and ITER, is the development of an economically viable method of using energy from a controlled fusion reaction",6
Nuclear fusion is the origin of the energy (including in the form of light and other electromagnetic radiation) produced by the core of all stars including our own Sun    Nuclear fission   Nuclear fission is the reverse process to fusionFor nuclei heavier than nickel-62 the binding energy per nucleon decreases with the mass numberIt is therefore possible for energy to be released if a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two lighter ones,6
"The process of alpha decay is in essence a special type of spontaneous nuclear fissionIt is a highly asymmetrical fission because the four particles which make up the alpha particle are especially tightly bound to each other, making production of this nucleus in fission particularly likelyFrom several of the heaviest nuclei whose fission produces free neutrons, and which also easily absorb neutrons to initiate fission, a self-igniting type of neutron-initiated fission can be obtained, in a chain reaction",6
"Chain reactions were known in chemistry before physics, and in fact many familiar processes like fires and chemical explosions are chemical chain reactionsThe fission or ""nuclear"" chain-reaction, using fission-produced neutrons, is the source of energy for nuclear power plants and fission-type nuclear bombs, such as those detonated in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, at the end of World War IIHeavy nuclei such as uranium and thorium may also undergo spontaneous fission, but they are much more likely to undergo decay by alpha decay",6
"For a neutron-initiated chain reaction to occur, there must be a critical mass of the relevant isotope present in a certain space under certain conditionsThe conditions for the smallest critical mass require the conservation of the emitted neutrons and also their slowing or moderation so that there is a greater cross-section or probability of them initiating another fissionIn two regions of Oklo, Gabon, Africa, natural nuclear fission reactors were active over 1.5 billion years ago",6
"Measurements of natural neutrino emission have demonstrated that around half of the heat emanating from the Earth's core results from radioactive decayHowever, it is not known if any of this results from fission chain reactions    Production of ""heavy"" elements    According to the theory, as the Universe cooled after the Big Bang it eventually became possible for common subatomic particles as we know them (neutrons, protons and electrons) to existThe most common particles created in the Big Bang which are still easily observable to us today were protons and electrons (in equal numbers)",6
"The protons would eventually form hydrogen atomsAlmost all the neutrons created in the Big Bang were absorbed into helium-4 in the first three minutes after the Big Bang, and this helium accounts for most of the helium in the universe today (see Big Bang nucleosynthesis)Some relatively small quantities of elements beyond helium (lithium, beryllium, and perhaps some boron) were created in the Big Bang, as the protons and neutrons collided with each other, but all of the ""heavier elements"" (carbon, element number 6, and elements of greater atomic number) that we see today, were created inside stars during a series of fusion stages, such as the proton–proton chain, the CNO cycle and the triple-alpha process",6
"Progressively heavier elements are created during the evolution of a starEnergy is only released in fusion processes involving smaller atoms than iron because the binding energy per nucleon peaks around iron (56 nucleons)Since the creation of heavier nuclei by fusion requires energy, nature resorts to the process of neutron captureNeutrons (due to their lack of charge) are readily absorbed by a nucleusThe heavy elements are created by either a slow neutron capture process (the so-called s-process) or the rapid, or r-process",6
"The s process occurs in thermally pulsing stars (called AGB, or asymptotic giant branch stars) and takes hundreds to thousands of years to reach the heaviest elements of lead and bismuthThe r-process is thought to occur in supernova explosions, which provide the necessary conditions of high temperature, high neutron flux and ejected matterThese stellar conditions make the successive neutron captures very fast, involving very neutron-rich species which then beta-decay to heavier elements, especially at the so-called waiting points that correspond to more stable nuclides with closed neutron shells (magic numbers)",6

"Particle physics (also known as high energy physics) is a branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute matter and radiationAlthough the word particle can refer to various types of very small objects (e.gprotons, gas particles, or even household dust), particle physics usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the fundamental interactions necessary to explain their behaviour In current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions",6
"The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard ModelThus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.gto the newest ""known"" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity    Subatomic particles    Modern particle physics research is focused on subatomic particles, including atomic constituents, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons (protons and neutrons are composite particles called baryons, made of quarks), that are produced by radioactive and scattering processes; such particles are photons, neutrinos, and muons, as well as a wide range of exotic particles.Dynamics of particles are also governed by quantum mechanics; they exhibit wave–particle duality, displaying particle-like behaviour under certain experimental conditions and wave-like behaviour in others",6
"In more technical terms, they are described by quantum state vectors in a Hilbert space, which is also treated in quantum field theoryFollowing the convention of particle physicists, the term elementary particles is applied to those particles that are, according to current understanding, presumed to be indivisible and not composed of other particles All particles and their interactions observed to date can be described almost entirely by a quantum field theory called the Standard Model",6
"The Standard Model, as currently formulated, has 61 elementary particlesThose elementary particles can combine to form composite particles, accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960sThe Standard Model has been found to agree with almost all the experimental tests conducted to dateHowever, most particle physicists believe that it is an incomplete description of nature and that a more fundamental theory awaits discovery (See Theory of Everything)",6
"In recent years, measurements of neutrino mass have provided the first experimental deviations from the Standard Model, since neutrinos are massless in the Standard Model    History    The idea that all matter is fundamentally composed of elementary particles dates from at least the 6th century BCIn the 19th century, John Dalton, through his work on stoichiometry, concluded that each element of nature was composed of a single, unique type of particleThe word atom, after the Greek word atomos meaning ""indivisible"", has since then denoted the smallest particle of a chemical element, but physicists soon discovered that atoms are not, in fact, the fundamental particles of nature, but are conglomerates of even smaller particles, such as the electron",6
"The early 20th century explorations of nuclear physics and quantum physics led to proofs of nuclear fission in 1939 by Lise Meitner (based on experiments by Otto Hahn), and nuclear fusion by Hans Bethe in that same year; both discoveries also led to the development of nuclear weaponsThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, a bewildering variety of particles were found in collisions of particles from beams of increasingly high energyIt was referred to informally as the ""particle zoo""",6
"Important discoveries such as the CP violation by James Cronin and Val Fitch brought new questions to matter-antimatter imbalance After the formulation of the Standard Model during the 1970s, physicists clarified the origin of the particle zooThe large number of particles was explained as combinations of a (relatively) small number of more fundamental particles and framed in the context of quantum field theoriesThis reclassification marked the beginning of modern particle physics",6
"    Standard Model    The current state of the classification of all elementary particles is explained by the Standard Model, which gained widespread acceptance in the mid-1970s after experimental confirmation of the existence of quarksIt describes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental interactions, using mediating gauge bosonsThe species of gauge bosons are eight gluons, W−, W+ and Z bosons, and the photonThe Standard Model also contains 24 fundamental fermions (12 particles and their associated anti-particles), which are the constituents of all matter",6
"Finally, the Standard Model also predicted the existence of a type of boson known as the Higgs bosonOn 4 July 2012, physicists with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced they had found a new particle that behaves similarly to what is expected from the Higgs boson    Experimental laboratories    The world's major particle physics laboratories are:  Brookhaven National Laboratory (Long Island, United States)Its main facility is the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which collides heavy ions such as gold ions and polarized protons",6
"It is the world's first heavy ion collider, and the world's only polarized proton colliderBudker Institute of Nuclear Physics (Novosibirsk, Russia)Its main projects are now the electron-positron colliders VEPP-2000, operated since 2006, and VEPP-4, started experiments in 1994Earlier facilities include the first electron–electron beam–beam collider VEP-1, which conducted experiments from 1964 to 1968; the electron-positron colliders VEPP-2, operated from 1965 to 1974; and, its successor VEPP-2M, performed experiments from 1974 to 2000",6
"CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) (Franco-Swiss border, near Geneva)Its main project is now the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which had its first beam circulation on 10 September 2008, and is now the world's most energetic collider of protonsIt also became the most energetic collider of heavy ions after it began colliding lead ionsEarlier facilities include the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP), which was stopped on 2 November 2000 and then dismantled to give way for LHC; and the Super Proton Synchrotron, which is being reused as a pre-accelerator for the LHC and for fixed-target experiments",6
"DESY (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron) (Hamburg, Germany)Its main facility was the Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage (HERA), which collided electrons and positrons with protonsThe accelerator complex is now focused on the production of synchrotron radiation with PETRA III, FLASH and the European XFELFermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) (Batavia, United States)Its main facility until 2011 was the Tevatron, which collided protons and antiprotons and was the highest-energy particle collider on earth until the Large Hadron Collider surpassed it on 29 November 2009",6

"SLAC staff continue to participate in developing and building many particle detectors around the world.Many other particle accelerators also existThe techniques required for modern experimental particle physics are quite varied and complex, constituting a sub-specialty nearly completely distinct from the theoretical side of the field    Theory   Theoretical particle physics attempts to develop the models, theoretical framework, and mathematical tools to understand current experiments and make predictions for future experiments (see also theoretical physics)",6
"There are several major interrelated efforts being made in theoretical particle physics todayOne important branch attempts to better understand the Standard Model and its testsTheorists make quantitative predictions of observables at collider and astronomical experiments, which along with experimental measurements is used to extract the parameters of the Standard Model with less uncertaintyThis work probes the limits of the Standard Model and therefore expands scientific understanding of nature's building blocks",6
"Those efforts are made challenging by the difficulty of calculating high precision quantities in quantum chromodynamicsSome theorists working in this area use the tools of perturbative quantum field theory and effective field theory, referring to themselves as phenomenologistsOthers make use of lattice field theory and call themselves lattice theoristsAnother major effort is in model building where model builders develop ideas for what physics may lie beyond the Standard Model (at higher energies or smaller distances)",6
"This work is often motivated by the hierarchy problem and is constrained by existing experimental dataIt may involve work on supersymmetry, alternatives to the Higgs mechanism, extra spatial dimensions (such as the Randall–Sundrum models), Preon theory, combinations of these, or other ideasA third major effort in theoretical particle physics is string theoryString theorists attempt to construct a unified description of quantum mechanics and general relativity by building a theory based on small strings, and branes rather than particles",6
"If the theory is successful, it may be considered a ""Theory of Everything"", or ""TOE""There are also other areas of work in theoretical particle physics ranging from particle cosmology to loop quantum gravity.This division of efforts in particle physics is reflected in the names of categories on the arXiv, a preprint archive: hep-th (theory), hep-ph (phenomenology), hep-ex (experiments), hep-lat (lattice gauge theory)    Practical applications   In principle, all physics (and practical applications developed therefrom) can be derived from the study of fundamental particles",6
"In practice, even if ""particle physics"" is taken to mean only ""high-energy atom smashers"", many technologies have been developed during these pioneering investigations that later find wide uses in societyParticle accelerators are used to produce medical isotopes for research and treatment (for example, isotopes used in PET imaging), or used directly in external beam radiotherapyThe development of superconductors has been pushed forward by their use in particle physicsThe World Wide Web and touchscreen technology were initially developed at CERN",6
"Additional applications are found in medicine, national security, industry, computing, science, and workforce development, illustrating a long and growing list of beneficial practical applications with contributions from particle physics    Future   The primary goal, which is pursued in several distinct ways, is to find and understand what physics may lie beyond the standard modelThere are several powerful experimental reasons to expect new physics, including dark matter and neutrino massThere are also theoretical hints that this new physics should be found at accessible energy scales",6
"Much of the effort to find this new physics are focused on new collider experimentsThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was completed in 2008 to help continue the search for the Higgs boson, supersymmetric particles, and other new physicsAn intermediate goal is the construction of the International Linear Collider (ILC), which will complement the LHC by allowing more precise measurements of the properties of newly found particlesIn August 2004, a decision for the technology of the ILC was taken but the site has still to be agreed upon",6
"In addition, there are important non-collider experiments that also attempt to find and understand physics beyond the Standard ModelOne important non-collider effort is the determination of the neutrino masses, since these masses may arise from neutrinos mixing with very heavy particlesIn addition, cosmological observations provide many useful constraints on the dark matter, although it may be impossible to determine the exact nature of the dark matter without the collidersFinally, lower bounds on the very long lifetime of the proton put constraints on Grand Unified Theories at energy scales much higher than collider experiments will be able to probe any time soon",6

"Plasma (from Ancient Greek  πλάσμα 'moldable substance') is one of the four fundamental states of matterIt contains a significant portion of charged particles – ions and/or electronsThe presence of these charged particles is what primarily sets plasma apart from the other fundamental states of matterIt is the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe, being mostly associated with stars, including the SunIt extends to the rarefied intracluster medium and possibly to intergalactic regions",6
"Plasma can be artificially generated by heating a neutral gas or subjecting it to a strong electromagnetic fieldThe presence of charged particles makes plasma electrically conductive, with the dynamics of individual particles and macroscopic plasma motion governed by collective electromagnetic fields and very sensitive to externally applied fieldsThe response of plasma to electromagnetic fields is used in many modern technological devices, such as plasma televisions or plasma etching.Depending on temperature and density, a certain amount of neutral particles may also be present, in which case plasma is called partially ionized",6
"Neon signs and lightning are examples of partially ionized plasmasUnlike the phase transitions between the other three states of matter, the transition to plasma is not well defined and is a matter of interpretation and contextWhether a given degree of ionization suffices to call a substance 'plasma' depends on the specific phenomenon being considered    Early history    Plasma was first identified in laboratory by Sir William CrookesCrookes presented a lecture on what he called ""radiant matter"" to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, in Sheffield, on Friday, 22 August 1879",6
"Systematic studies of plasma began with the research of Irving Langmuir and his colleagues in the 1920sLangmuir also introduced the term ""plasma"" as a description of ionized gas in 1928: Except near the electrodes, where there are sheaths containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very smallWe shall use the name plasma to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons",6
"Lewi Tonks and Harold Mott-Smith, both of whom worked with Langmuir in the 1920s, recall that Langmuir first used the term by analogy with the blood plasmaMott-Smith recalls, in particular, that the transport of electrons from thermionic filaments reminded Langmuir of ""the way blood plasma carries red and white corpuscles and germs.""     Definitions       The fourth state of matter   Plasma is called the fourth state of matter after solid, liquid, and gas",6
"It is a state of matter in which an ionized substance becomes highly electrically conductive to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate its behaviour.Plasma is typically an electrically quasineutral medium of unbound positive and negative particles (i.ethe overall charge of a plasma is roughly zero)Although these particles are unbound, they are not ""free"" in the sense of not experiencing forcesMoving charged particles generate electric currents, and any movement of a charged plasma particle affects and is affected by the fields created by the other charges",6
"In turn this governs collective behaviour with many degrees of variation.Plasma is distinct from the other states of matterIn particular, describing a low-density plasma as merely an ""ionized gas"" is wrong and misleading, even though it is similar to the gas phase in that both assume no definite shape or volumeThe following table summarizes some principal differences:     Ideal plasma   Three factors define an ideal plasma: The plasma approximation: The plasma approximation applies when the plasma parameter Λ, representing the number of charge carriers within the Debye sphere is much higher than unity",6
"It can be readily shown that this criterion is equivalent to smallness of the ratio of the plasma electrostatic and thermal energy densitiesSuch plasmas are called weakly coupledBulk interactions: The Debye length is much smaller than the physical size of the plasmaThis criterion means that interactions in the bulk of the plasma are more important than those at its edges, where boundary effects may take placeWhen this criterion is satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral",6
"Collisionlessness: The electron plasma frequency (measuring plasma oscillations of the electrons) is much larger than the electron–neutral collision frequencyWhen this condition is valid, electrostatic interactions dominate over the processes of ordinary gas kineticsSuch plasmas are called collisionless    Non-neutral plasma    The strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges in any sizeable region are equal (""quasineutrality"")",6
"A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasmaIn such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant roleExamples are charged particle beams, an electron cloud in a Penning trap and positron plasmas    Dusty plasma    A dusty plasma contains tiny charged particles of dust (typically found in space)The dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other",6
"A plasma that contains larger particles is called grain plasmaUnder laboratory conditions, dusty plasmas are also called complex plasmas    Properties and parameters       Density and ionization degree   For plasma to exist, ionization is necessaryThe term ""plasma density"" by itself usually refers to the electron density                                    n                        e                                     {\displaystyle n_{e}}   , that is, the number of charge-contributing electrons per unit volumeThe degree of ionization                         α                 {\displaystyle \alpha }    is defined as fraction of neutral particles that are ionized:  where                                    n                        i                                     {\displaystyle n_{i}}    is the ion density and                                    n                        n                                     {\displaystyle n_{n}}    the neutral density (in number of particles per unit volume)",6

"High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, which is a defining feature of a plasmaThe degree of plasma ionization is determined by the electron temperature relative to the ionization energy (and more weakly by the density)In thermal equilibrium, the relationship is given by the Saha equationAt low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states—atoms—and the plasma will eventually become a gasIn most cases, the electrons and heavy plasma particles (ions and neutral atoms) separately have a relatively well-defined temperature; that is, their energy distribution function is close to a Maxwellian even in the presence of strong electric or magnetic fields",6
"However, because of the large difference in mass between electrons and ions, their temperatures may be different, sometimes significantly soThis is especially common in weakly ionized technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature while electrons reach thousands of kelvinThe opposite case is the z-pinch plasma where the ion temperature may exceed that of electrons    Plasma potential    Since plasmas are very good electrical conductors, electric potentials play an important role",6
"The average potential in the space between charged particles, independent of how it can be measured, is called the ""plasma potential"", or the ""space potential""If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a Debye sheathThe good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very smallThis results in the important concept of ""quasineutrality"", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (                                   n                        e                                       ⟨         Z         ⟩                    n                        i                                     {\displaystyle n_{e} \langle Z\rangle n_{i}}   ), but on the scale of the Debye length, there can be charge imbalance",6
"In the special case that double layers are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net charge densityA common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the Boltzmann relation:  Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:  It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral",6
"An electron beam, for example, has only negative chargesThe density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise, it will be dissipated by the repulsive electrostatic force    Magnetization   The existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fieldsPlasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized",6
"A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic-field line before making a collision, i.e.,                                    ν                                       c               e                                                     /                             ν                                       c               o               l               l                                          >         1                 {\displaystyle \nu _{\mathrm {ce} }/\nu _{\mathrm {coll} }>1}   , where                                    ν                                       c               e                                                  {\displaystyle \nu _{\mathrm {ce} }}    is the electron gyrofrequency and                                    ν                                       c               o               l               l                                                  {\displaystyle \nu _{\mathrm {coll} }}    is the electron collision rate",6
"It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are notMagnetized plasmas are anisotropic, meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to itWhile electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the plasma high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving with velocity                                    v                          {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }    in the magnetic field                                    B                          {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} }    is given by the usual Lorentz formula                                    E                            −                    v                  ×                    B                          {\displaystyle \mathbf {E}  -\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} }   , and is not affected by Debye shielding",6
"    Mathematical descriptions    To completely describe the state of a plasma, all of the particle locations and velocities that describe the electromagnetic field in the plasma region would need to be written downHowever, it is generally not practical or necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasmaTherefore, plasma physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions, of which there are two main types:     Fluid model   Fluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see Plasma parameters)",6
"One simple fluid model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of Maxwell's equations and the Navier–Stokes equationsA more general description is the two-fluid plasma, where the ions and electrons are described separatelyFluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distributionBecause fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve wave-particle effects",6
"    Kinetic model   Kinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann distributionA kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmasThere are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasmaOne is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and positionThe other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles",6
"Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid modelsThe Vlasov equation may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic fieldIn magnetized plasmas, a gyrokinetic approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation    Plasma science and technology   Plasmas are the object of study of the academic field of plasma science or plasma physics, including sub-disciplines such as space plasma physics",6
"It currently involves the following fields of active research and features across many journals, whose interest includes:  Plasmas can appear in nature in various forms and locations, which can be usefully broadly summarised in the following Table:     Space and astrophysics    Plasmas are by far the most common phase of ordinary matter in the universe, both by mass and by volume.Above the Earth's surface, the ionosphere is a plasma, and the magnetosphere contains plasma",6
"Within our Solar System, interplanetary space is filled with the plasma expelled via the solar wind, extending from the Sun's surface out to the heliopauseFurthermore, all the distant stars, and much of interstellar space or intergalactic space is also likely filled with plasma, albeit at very low densitiesAstrophysical plasmas are also observed in accretion disks around stars or compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes in close binary star systems",6
"Plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets, which have been observed with accreting black holes or in active galaxies like M87's jet that possibly extends out to 5,000 light-years    Artificial plasmas   Most artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields through a gasPlasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by:  The type of power source used to generate the plasma—DC, AC (typically with radio frequency (RF)) and microwave The pressure they operate at—vacuum pressure (< 10 mTorr or 1 Pa), moderate pressure (≈1 Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760 Torr or 100 kPa) The degree of ionization within the plasma—fully, partially, or weakly ionized The temperature relationships within the plasma—thermal plasma (                                   T                        e                                                  T                        i                                                  T                        g             a             s                                     {\displaystyle T_{e} T_{i} T_{gas}}   ), non-thermal or ""cold"" plasma (                                   T                        e                             ≫                    T                        i                                                  T                        g             a             s                                     {\displaystyle T_{e}\gg T_{i} T_{gas}}   ) The electrode configuration used to generate the plasma The magnetization of the particles within the plasma—magnetized (both ion and electrons are trapped in Larmor orbits by the magnetic field), partially magnetized (the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field), non-magnetized (the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate Lorentz forces)      Generation of artificial plasma     Just like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its generation",6
"However, one principle is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain itFor this case, plasma is generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or fluid (an electrically non-conducting material) as can be seen in the adjacent image, which shows a discharge tube as a simple example (DC used for simplicity).The potential difference and subsequent electric field pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the anode (positive electrode) while the cathode (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus",6
"As the voltage increases, the current stresses the material (by electric polarization) beyond its dielectric limit (termed strength) into a stage of electrical breakdown, marked by an electric spark, where the material transforms from being an insulator into a conductor (as it becomes increasingly ionized)The underlying process is the Townsend avalanche, where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as can be seen in the figure on the right)",6
"The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electronsTherefore, the number of charged particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only ""after about 20 successive sets of collisions"", mainly due to a small mean free path (average distance travelled between collisions)     Electric arc     With ample current density and ionization, this forms a luminous electric arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the electrodes",6
"Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization is determined by temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasmaA thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, which is to say that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.eatoms, molecules and ions) and electronsThis is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles",6
"     Examples of industrial/commercial plasma    Because of their sizable temperature and density ranges, plasmas find applications in many fields of research, technology and industryFor example, in: industrial and extractive metallurgy, surface treatments such as plasma spraying (coating), etching in microelectronics, metal cutting and welding; as well as in everyday vehicle exhaust cleanup and fluorescent/luminescent lamps, fuel ignition, while even playing a part in supersonic combustion engines for aerospace engineering     Low-pressure discharges    Glow discharge plasmas: non-thermal plasmas generated by the application of DC or low frequency RF (<100 kHz) electric field to the gap between two metal electrodes",6
"Probably the most common plasma; this is the type of plasma generated within fluorescent light tubesCapacitively coupled plasma (CCP): similar to glow discharge plasmas, but generated with high frequency RF electric fields, typically 13.56 MHzThese differ from glow discharges in that the sheaths are much less intenseThese are widely used in the microfabrication and integrated circuit manufacturing industries for plasma etching and plasma enhanced chemical vapor depositionCascaded Arc Plasma Source: a device to produce low temperature (≈1eV) high density plasmas (HDP)",6
"Inductively coupled plasma (ICP): similar to a CCP and with similar applications but the electrode consists of a coil wrapped around the chamber where plasma is formedWave heated plasma: similar to CCP and ICP in that it is typically RF (or microwave)Examples include helicon discharge and electron cyclotron resonance (ECR)     Atmospheric pressure    Arc discharge: this is a high power thermal discharge of very high temperature (≈10,000 K)It can be generated using various power supplies",6
"It is commonly used in metallurgical processesFor example, it is used to smelt minerals containing Al2O3 to produce aluminiumCorona discharge: this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltage to sharp electrode tipsIt is commonly used in ozone generators and particle precipitatorsDielectric barrier discharge (DBD): this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc",6
"It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona dischargesA common usage of this discharge is in a plasma actuator for vehicle drag reductionIt is also widely used in the web treatment of fabricsThe application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhereThe dielectric barrier discharge was used in the mid-1990s to show that low temperature atmospheric pressure plasma is effective in inactivating bacterial cells",6
"This work and later experiments using mammalian cells led to the establishment of a new field of research known as plasma medicineThe dielectric barrier discharge configuration was also used in the design of low temperature plasma jetsThese plasma jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionization waves known as plasma bulletsCapacitive discharge: this is a nonthermal plasma generated by the application of RF power (e.g., 13.56 MHz) to one powered electrode, with a grounded electrode held at a small separation distance on the order of 1 cm",6
"Such discharges are commonly stabilized using a noble gas such as helium or argon""Piezoelectric direct discharge plasma:"" is a nonthermal plasma generated at the high-side of a piezoelectric transformer (PT)This generation variant is particularly suited for high efficient and compact devices where a separate high voltage power supply is not desired     MHD converters     A world effort was triggered in the 1960s to study magnetohydrodynamic converters in order to bring MHD power conversion to market with commercial power plants of a new kind, converting the kinetic energy of a high velocity plasma into electricity with no moving parts at a high efficiency",6
"Research was also conducted in the field of supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics to study plasma interaction with magnetic fields to eventually achieve passive and even active flow control around vehicles or projectiles, in order to soften and mitigate shock waves, lower thermal transfer and reduce drag.Such ionized gases used in ""plasma technology"" (""technological"" or ""engineered"" plasmas) are usually weakly ionized gases in the sense that only a tiny fraction of the gas molecules are ionized",6
"These kinds of weakly ionized gases are also nonthermal ""cold"" plasmasIn the presence of magnetics fields, the study of such magnetized nonthermal weakly ionized gases involves resistive magnetohydrodynamics with low magnetic Reynolds number, a challenging field of plasma physics where calculations require dyadic tensors in a 7-dimensional phase spaceWhen used in combination with a high Hall parameter, a critical value triggers the problematic electrothermal instability which limited these technological developments",6
"    Complex plasma phenomena   Although the underlying equations governing plasmas are relatively simple, plasma behaviour is extraordinarily varied and subtle: the emergence of unexpected behaviour from a simple model is a typical feature of a complex systemSuch systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and disordered behaviour and cannot typically be described either by simple, smooth, mathematical functions, or by pure randomnessThe spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features on a wide range of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity",6
"The features are interesting, for example, because they are very sharp, spatially intermittent (the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves), or have a fractal formMany of these features were first studied in the laboratory, and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universeExamples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include:     Filamentation   Striations or string-like structures, also known as Birkeland currents, are seen in many plasmas, like the plasma ball, the aurora, lightning, electric arcs, solar flares, and supernova remnants",6
"They are sometimes associated with larger current densities, and the interaction with the magnetic field can form a magnetic rope structure(See also Plasma pinch) Filamentation also refers to the self-focusing of a high power laser pulseAt high powers, the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more",6
"The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasmaThe plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beamThe interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be micrometers to kilometers in lengthOne interesting aspect of the filamentation generated plasma is the relatively low ion density due to defocusing effects of the ionized electrons",6
"(See also Filament propagation)     Impermeable plasma   Impermeable plasma is a type of thermal plasma which acts like an impermeable solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushedInteraction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor wallsHowever, later it was found that the external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls",6
"In 2013, a group of materials scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gasWhile spectroscopic data on the characteristics of plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinementThey also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials",6
"In physics, power is the amount of energy transferred or converted per unit timeIn the International System of Units, the unit of power is the watt, equal to one joule per secondIn older works, power is sometimes called activityPower is a scalar quantityPower is related to other quantities; for example, the power involved in moving a ground vehicle is the product of the traction force on the wheels and the velocity of the vehicle",6

"Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.: 1.1  It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information scienceClassical physics, the collection of theories that existed before the advent of quantum mechanics, describes many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic) scale, but is not sufficient for describing them at small (atomic and subatomic) scales",6
"Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle)",6
"Quantum mechanics arose gradually from theories to explain observations which could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper which explained the photoelectric effectThese early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the ""old quantum theory"", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and others",6
"The modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalismsIn one of them, a mathematical entity called the wave function provides information, in the form of probability amplitudes, about what measurements of a particle's energy, momentum, and other physical properties may yield    Overview and fundamental concepts   Quantum mechanics allows the calculation of properties and behaviour of physical systemsIt is typically applied to microscopic systems: molecules, atoms and sub-atomic particles",6
"It has been demonstrated to hold for complex molecules with thousands of atoms, but its application to human beings raises philosophical problems, such as Wigner's friend, and its application to the universe as a whole remains speculativePredictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy.A fundamental feature of the theory is that it usually cannot predict with certainty what will happen, but only give probabilities",6
"Mathematically, a probability is found by taking the square of the absolute value of a complex number, known as a probability amplitudeThis is known as the Born rule, named after physicist Max BornFor example, a quantum particle like an electron can be described by a wave function, which associates to each point in space a probability amplitudeApplying the Born rule to these amplitudes gives a probability density function for the position that the electron will be found to have when an experiment is performed to measure it",6
"This is the best the theory can do; it cannot say for certain where the electron will be foundThe Schrödinger equation relates the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to one moment of time to the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to anotherOne consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is a tradeoff in predictability between different measurable quantitiesThe most famous form of this uncertainty principle says that no matter how a quantum particle is prepared or how carefully experiments upon it are arranged, it is impossible to have a precise prediction for a measurement of its position and also at the same time for a measurement of its momentum",6
"Another consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is the phenomenon of quantum interference, which is often illustrated with the double-slit experimentIn the basic version of this experiment, a coherent light source, such as a laser beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate.: 102–111 : 1.1–1.8  The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to interfere, producing bright and dark bands on the screen – a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles",6
"However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles rather than waves; the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screenFurthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected photon passes through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave).: 109  However, such experiments demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through",6
"Other atomic-scale entities, such as electrons, are found to exhibit the same behavior when fired towards a double slitThis behavior is known as wave-particle dualityAnother counter-intuitive phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics is quantum tunnelling: a particle that goes up against a potential barrier can cross it, even if its kinetic energy is smaller than the maximum of the potentialIn classical mechanics this particle would be trappedQuantum tunnelling has several important consequences, enabling radioactive decay, nuclear fusion in stars, and applications such as scanning tunnelling microscopy and the tunnel diode.When quantum systems interact, the result can be the creation of quantum entanglement: their properties become so intertwined that a description of the whole solely in terms of the individual parts is no longer possible",6
"Erwin Schrödinger called entanglement ""...the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought""Quantum entanglement enables the counter-intuitive properties of quantum pseudo-telepathy, and can be a valuable resource in communication protocols, such as quantum key distribution and superdense codingContrary to popular misconception, entanglement does not allow sending signals faster than light, as demonstrated by the no-communication theorem.Another possibility opened by entanglement is testing for ""hidden variables"", hypothetical properties more fundamental than the quantities addressed in quantum theory itself, knowledge of which would allow more exact predictions than quantum theory can provide",6
"A collection of results, most significantly Bell's theorem, have demonstrated that broad classes of such hidden-variable theories are in fact incompatible with quantum physicsAccording to Bell's theorem, if nature actually operates in accord with any theory of local hidden variables, then the results of a Bell test will be constrained in a particular, quantifiable wayMany Bell tests have been performed, using entangled particles, and they have shown results incompatible with the constraints imposed by local hidden variables.It is not possible to present these concepts in more than a superficial way without introducing the actual mathematics involved; understanding quantum mechanics requires not only manipulating complex numbers, but also linear algebra, differential equations, group theory, and other more advanced subjects",6
"Accordingly, this article will present a mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics and survey its application to some useful and oft-studied examples    Mathematical formulation    In the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum mechanical system is a vector                         ψ                 {\displaystyle \psi }    belonging to a (separable) complex Hilbert space                                                 H                                     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}}   This vector is postulated to be normalized under the Hilbert space inner product, that is, it obeys                         ⟨         ψ         ,         ψ         ⟩                   1                 {\displaystyle \langle \psi ,\psi \rangle  1}   , and it is well-defined up to a complex number of modulus 1 (the global phase), that is,                         ψ                 {\displaystyle \psi }    and                                    e                        i             α                             ψ                 {\displaystyle e^{i\alpha }\psi }    represent the same physical system",6
"In other words, the possible states are points in the projective space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective spaceThe exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system – for example, for describing position and momentum the Hilbert space is the space of complex square-integrable functions                                    L                        2                             (                    C                  )                 {\displaystyle L^{2}(\mathbb {C} )}   , while the Hilbert space for the spin of a single proton is simply the space of two-dimensional complex vectors                                                 C                                   2                                     {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{2}}    with the usual inner product",6
"Physical quantities of interest – position, momentum, energy, spin – are represented by observables, which are Hermitian (more precisely, self-adjoint) linear operators acting on the Hilbert spaceA quantum state can be an eigenvector of an observable, in which case it is called an eigenstate, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstateMore generally, a quantum state will be a linear combination of the eigenstates, known as a quantum superposition",6
"When an observable is measured, the result will be one of its eigenvalues with probability given by the Born rule: in the simplest case the eigenvalue                         λ                 {\displaystyle \lambda }    is non-degenerate and the probability is given by                                    |                  ⟨                                                λ               →                                          ,         ψ         ⟩                                 |                                   2                                     {\displaystyle |\langle {\vec {\lambda }},\psi \rangle |^{2}}   , where                                                                λ               →                                                  {\displaystyle {\vec {\lambda }}}    is its associated eigenvectorMore generally, the eigenvalue is degenerate and the probability is given by                         ⟨         ψ         ,                    P                        λ                             ψ         ⟩                 {\displaystyle \langle \psi ,P_{\lambda }\psi \rangle }   , where                                    P                        λ                                     {\displaystyle P_{\lambda }}    is the projector onto its associated eigenspace",6
"In the continuous case, these formulas give instead the probability densityAfter the measurement, if result                         λ                 {\displaystyle \lambda }    was obtained, the quantum state is postulated to collapse to                                                                λ               →                                                  {\displaystyle {\vec {\lambda }}}   , in the non-degenerate case, or to                                    P                        λ                             ψ                    /                                          ⟨             ψ             ,                            P                                λ                                         ψ             ⟩                                     {\displaystyle P_{\lambda }\psi /{\sqrt {\langle \psi ,P_{\lambda }\psi \rangle }}}   , in the general caseThe probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement",6
"This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understandIt was the central topic in the famous Bohr–Einstein debates, in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experimentsIn the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a ""measurement"" has been extensively studiedNewer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of ""wave function collapse"" (see, for example, the many-worlds interpretation)",6
"The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wave functions become entangled so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entityFor details, see the article on measurement in quantum mechanics.The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schrödinger equation:                         i         ℏ                                 d                            d               t                                          ψ         (         t         )                   H         ψ         (         t         )                         {\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {d}{dt}}\psi (t) H\psi (t).}   Here                         H                 {\displaystyle H}    denotes the Hamiltonian, the observable corresponding to the total energy of the system, and                         ℏ                 {\displaystyle \hbar }    is the reduced Planck constant",6
"The constant                         i         ℏ                 {\displaystyle i\hbar }    is introduced so that the Hamiltonian is reduced to the classical Hamiltonian in cases where the quantum system can be approximated by a classical system; the ability to make such an approximation in certain limits is called the correspondence principleThe solution of this differential equation is given by                         ψ         (         t         )                              e                        −             i             H             t                            /                          ℏ                             ψ         (         0         )                         {\displaystyle \psi (t) e^{-iHt/\hbar }\psi (0).}   The operator                         U         (         t         )                              e                        −             i             H             t                            /                          ℏ                                     {\displaystyle U(t) e^{-iHt/\hbar }}    is known as the time-evolution operator, and has the crucial property that it is unitary",6
"This time evolution is deterministic in the sense that – given an initial quantum state                         ψ         (         0         )                 {\displaystyle \psi (0)}     – it makes a definite prediction of what the quantum state                         ψ         (         t         )                 {\displaystyle \psi (t)}    will be at any later time Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are independent of time, such as eigenstates of the HamiltonianMany systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such ""static"" wave functions",6
"For example, a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus, whereas in quantum mechanics, it is described by a static wave function surrounding the nucleusFor example, the electron wave function for an unexcited hydrogen atom is a spherically symmetric function known as an s orbital (Fig1)Analytic solutions of the Schrödinger equation are known for very few relatively simple model Hamiltonians including the quantum harmonic oscillator, the particle in a box, the dihydrogen cation, and the hydrogen atom",6
"Even the helium atom – which contains just two electrons – has defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatmentHowever, there are techniques for finding approximate solutionsOne method, called perturbation theory, uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to create a result for a related but more complicated model by (for example) the addition of a weak potential energyAnother method is called ""semi-classical equation of motion"", which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only small deviations from classical behavior",6
"These deviations can then be computed based on the classical motionThis approach is particularly important in the field of quantum chaos    Uncertainty principle   One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the uncertainty principleIn its most familiar form, this states that no preparation of a quantum particle can imply simultaneously precise predictions both for a measurement of its position and for a measurement of its momentumBoth position and momentum are observables, meaning that they are represented by Hermitian operators",6

"    Applications    Quantum mechanics has had enormous success in explaining many of the features of our universe, with regards to small-scale and discrete quantities and interactions which cannot be explained by classical methodsQuantum mechanics is often the only theory that can reveal the individual behaviors of the subatomic particles that make up all forms of matter (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, and others)Solid-state physics and materials science are dependent upon quantum mechanics.In many aspects modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant",6
"Important applications of quantum theory include quantum chemistry, quantum optics, quantum computing, superconducting magnets, light-emitting diodes, the optical amplifier and the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such as the microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopyExplanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted in the nature of the chemical bond, most notably the macro-molecule DNA    Relation to other scientific theories       Classical mechanics   The rules of quantum mechanics assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space and that observables of the system are Hermitian operators acting on vectors in that space – although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators",6
"These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system, a necessary step in making physical predictionsAn important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle, a heuristic which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics in the regime of large quantum numbersOne can also start from an established classical model of a particular system, and then try to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit",6
"This approach is known as quantizationWhen quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non-relativistic classical mechanicsFor instance, the well-known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic oscillatorComplications arise with chaotic systems, which do not have good quantum numbers, and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems",6
"Quantum decoherence is a mechanism through which quantum systems lose coherence, and thus become incapable of displaying many typically quantum effects: quantum superpositions become simply probabilistic mixtures, and quantum entanglement becomes simply classical correlationsQuantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales, except maybe at temperatures approaching absolute zero at which quantum behavior may manifest macroscopically.Many macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct consequence of the quantum behavior of its parts",6
"For example, the stability of bulk matter (consisting of atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces alone), the rigidity of solids, and the mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical and magnetic properties of matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the rules of quantum mechanics    Special relativity and electrodynamics   Early attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the Schrödinger equation with a covariant equation such as the Klein–Gordon equation or the Dirac equation",6
"While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particlesA fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory, which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles)The first complete quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics, provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interactionQuantum electrodynamics is, along with general relativity, one of the most accurate physical theories ever devised.The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems",6
"A simpler approach, one that has been used since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic fieldFor example, the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical                                    −                        e                            2                                                /                      (           4           π                        ϵ                                                                                 0                                                                   r           )                          {\displaystyle \textstyle -e^{2}/(4\pi \epsilon _{_{0}}r)}    Coulomb potentialThis ""semi-classical"" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of photons by charged particles",6
"Quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developedThe quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluonsThe weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg",6
"    Relation to general relativity   Even though the predictions of both quantum theory and general relativity have been supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence, their abstract formalisms contradict each other and they have proven extremely difficult to incorporate into one consistent, cohesive modelGravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics, so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those particular applicationsHowever, the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in physical cosmology and the search by physicists for an elegant ""Theory of Everything"" (TOE)",6
"Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th- and 21st-century physicsThis TOE would combine not only the models of subatomic physics but also derive the four fundamental forces of nature from a single force or phenomenonOne proposal for doing so is string theory, which posits that the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called stringsString theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other",6
"On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the stringIn string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.Another popular theory is loop quantum gravity (LQG), which describes quantum properties of gravity and is thus a theory of quantum spacetime",6
"LQG is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard general relativityThis theory describes space as an extremely fine fabric ""woven"" of finite loops called spin networksThe evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foamThe characteristic length scale of a spin foam is the Planck length, approximately 1.616×10−35 m, and so lengths shorter than the Planck length are not physically meaningful in LQG",6
"    Philosophical implications    Since its inception, the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretationsThe arguments centre on the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the difficulties with wavefunction collapse and the related measurement problem, and quantum nonlocalityPerhaps the only consensus that exists about these issues is that there is no consensusRichard Feynman once said, ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" According to Steven Weinberg, ""There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics.""The views of Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and other physicists are often grouped together as the ""Copenhagen interpretation""",6
"According to these views, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but is instead a final renunciation of the classical idea of ""causality""Bohr in particular emphasized that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the complementary nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situationsCopenhagen-type interpretations remain popular in the 21st century.Albert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, was troubled by its apparent failure to respect some cherished metaphysical principles, such as determinism and locality",6
"Einstein's long-running exchanges with Bohr about the meaning and status of quantum mechanics are now known as the Bohr–Einstein debatesEinstein believed that underlying quantum mechanics must be a theory that explicitly forbids action at a distanceHe argued that quantum mechanics was incomplete, a theory that was valid but not fundamental, analogous to how thermodynamics is valid, but the fundamental theory behind it is statistical mechanicsIn 1935, Einstein and his collaborators Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen published an argument that the principle of locality implies the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, a thought experiment later termed the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox",6
"In 1964, John Bell showed that EPR's principle of locality, together with determinism, was actually incompatible with quantum mechanics: they implied constraints on the correlations produced by distance systems, now known as Bell inequalities, that can be violated by entangled particlesSince then several experiments have been performed to obtain these correlations, with the result that they do in fact violate Bell inequalities, and thus falsify the conjunction of locality with determinism.Bohmian mechanics shows that it is possible to reformulate quantum mechanics to make it deterministic, at the price of making it explicitly nonlocal",6
"It attributes not only a wave function to a physical system, but in addition a real position, that evolves deterministically under a nonlocal guiding equationThe evolution of a physical system is given at all times by the Schrödinger equation together with the guiding equation; there is never a collapse of the wave functionThis solves the measurement problem.Everett's many-worlds interpretation, formulated in 1956, holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes",6
"This is a consequence of removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packetAll possible states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus, together with the observer, are present in a real physical quantum superpositionWhile the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we don't observe the multiverse as a whole, but only one parallel universe at a timeExactly how this is supposed to work has been the subject of much debate",6
"Several attempts have been made to make sense of this and derive the Born rule, with no consensus on whether they have been successful.Relational quantum mechanics appeared in the late 1990s as a modern derivative of Copenhagen-type ideas, and QBism was developed some years later    History    Quantum mechanics was developed in the early decades of the 20th century, driven by the need to explain phenomena that, in some cases, had been observed in earlier times",6
"Scientific inquiry into the wave nature of light began in the 17th and 18th centuries, when scientists such as Robert Hooke, Christiaan Huygens and Leonhard Euler proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observationsIn 1803 English polymath Thomas Young described the famous double-slit experimentThis experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of lightDuring the early 19th century, chemical research by John Dalton and Amedeo Avogadro lent weight to the atomic theory of matter, an idea that James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann and others built upon to establish the kinetic theory of gases",6
"The successes of kinetic theory gave further credence to the idea that matter is composed of atoms, yet the theory also had shortcomings that would only be resolved by the development of quantum mechanicsWhile the early conception of atoms from Greek philosophy had been that they were indivisible units –  the word ""atom"" deriving from the Greek for ""uncuttable"" –  the 19th century saw the formulation of hypotheses about subatomic structure",6
"One important discovery in that regard was Michael Faraday's 1838 observation of a glow caused by an electrical discharge inside a glass tube containing gas at low pressureJulius Plücker, Johann Wilhelm Hittorf and Eugen Goldstein carried on and improved upon Faraday's work, leading to the identification of cathode rays, which JJThomson found to consist of subatomic particles that would be called electrons.The black-body radiation problem was discovered by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1859",6
"In 1900, Max Planck proposed the hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete ""quanta"" (or energy packets), yielding a calculation that precisely matched the observed patterns of black-body radiationThe word quantum derives from the Latin, meaning ""how great"" or ""how much""According to Planck, quantities of energy could be thought of as divided into ""elements"" whose size (E) would be proportional to their frequency (ν):                         E                   h         ν                           {\displaystyle E h\nu \ }   ,where h is Planck's constant",6
"Planck cautiously insisted that this was only an aspect of the processes of absorption and emission of radiation and was not the physical reality of the radiationIn fact, he considered his quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the right answer rather than a sizable discoveryHowever, in 1905 Albert Einstein interpreted Planck's quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect, in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material",6
"Niels Bohr then developed Planck's ideas about radiation into a model of the hydrogen atom that successfully predicted the spectral lines of hydrogenEinstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could also be described as a particle (later called the photon), with a discrete amount of energy that depends on its frequencyIn his paper ""On the Quantum Theory of Radiation,"" Einstein expanded on the interaction between energy and matter to explain the absorption and emission of energy by atoms",6
"Although overshadowed at the time by his general theory of relativity, this paper articulated the mechanism underlying the stimulated emission of radiation, which became the basis of the laser This phase is known as the old quantum theoryNever complete or self-consistent, the old quantum theory was rather a set of heuristic corrections to classical mechanicsThe theory is now understood as a semi-classical approximation to modern quantum mechanicsNotable results from this period include, in addition to the work of Planck, Einstein and Bohr mentioned above, Einstein and Peter Debye's work on the specific heat of solids, Bohr and Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen's proof that classical physics cannot account for diamagnetism, and Arnold Sommerfeld's extension of the Bohr model to include special-relativistic effects",6
"In the mid-1920s quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physicsIn 1923, the French physicist Louis de Broglie put forward his theory of matter waves by stating that particles can exhibit wave characteristics and vice versaBuilding on de Broglie's approach, modern quantum mechanics was born in 1925, when the German physicists Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan developed matrix mechanics and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented wave mechanics",6
"Born introduced the probabilistic interpretation of Schrödinger's wave function in July 1926Thus, the entire field of quantum physics emerged, leading to its wider acceptance at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927.By 1930 quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by David Hilbert, Paul Dirac and John von Neumann with greater emphasis on measurement, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and philosophical speculation about the 'observer'It has since permeated many disciplines, including quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science",6
"It also provides a useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements, and describes the behaviors of atoms during chemical bonding and the flow of electrons in computer semiconductors, and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern technologiesWhile quantum mechanics was constructed to describe the world of the very small, it is also needed to explain some macroscopic phenomena such as superconductors and superfluids    See also       Explanatory notes       References       Further reading    On Wikibooks  This Quantum World     External links    J",6

"Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that employs mathematical models and abstractions of physical objects and systems to rationalize, explain and predict natural phenomenaThis is in contrast to experimental physics, which uses experimental tools to probe these phenomenaThe advancement of science generally depends on the interplay between experimental studies and theoryIn some cases, theoretical physics adheres to standards of mathematical rigour while giving little weight to experiments and observations",6
"For example, while developing special relativity, Albert Einstein was concerned with the Lorentz transformation which left Maxwell's equations invariant, but was apparently uninterested in the Michelson–Morley experiment on Earth's drift through a luminiferous aetherConversely, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for explaining the photoelectric effect, previously an experimental result lacking a theoretical formulation    Overview   A physical theory is a model of physical eventsIt is judged by the extent to which its predictions agree with empirical observations",6
"The quality of a physical theory is also judged on its ability to make new predictions which can be verified by new observationsA physical theory differs from a mathematical theorem in that while both are based on some form of axioms, judgment of mathematical applicability is not based on agreement with any experimental resultsA physical theory similarly differs from a mathematical theory, in the sense that the word ""theory"" has a different meaning in mathematical terms",6

"Theoretical physics consists of several different approachesIn this regard, theoretical particle physics forms a good exampleFor instance: ""phenomenologists"" might employ (semi-) empirical formulas and heuristics to agree with experimental results, often without deep physical understanding""Modelers"" (also called ""model-builders"") often appear much like phenomenologists, but try to model speculative theories that have certain desirable features (rather than on experimental data), or apply the techniques of mathematical modeling  to physics problems",6
" Some attempt to create approximate theories, called effective theories, because fully developed theories may be regarded as unsolvable or too complicatedOther theorists may try to unify, formalise, reinterpret or generalise extant theories, or create completely new ones altogetherSometimes the vision provided by pure mathematical systems can provide clues to how a physical system might be modeled; e.g., the notion, due to Riemann and others, that space itself might be curved",6
"Theoretical problems that need computational investigation are often the concern of computational physicsTheoretical advances may consist in setting aside old, incorrect paradigms (e.g., aether theory of light propagation, caloric theory of heat, burning consisting of evolving phlogiston, or astronomical bodies revolving around the Earth) or may be an alternative model that provides answers that are more accurate or that can be more widely appliedIn the latter case, a correspondence principle will be required to recover the previously known result",6
" Sometimes though, advances may proceed along different pathsFor example, an essentially correct theory may need some conceptual or factual revisions; atomic theory, first postulated millennia ago (by several thinkers in Greece and India) and the two-fluid theory of electricity  are two cases in this pointHowever, an exception to all the above is the wave–particle duality,  a theory combining aspects of different, opposing models via the Bohr complementarity principle Physical theories become accepted if they are able to make correct predictions and no (or few) incorrect ones",6
"The theory should have, at least as a secondary objective, a certain economy and elegance (compare to mathematical beauty), a notion sometimes called ""Occam's razor"" after the 13th-century English philosopher William of Occam (or Ockham), in which the simpler of two theories that describe the same matter just as adequately is preferred (but conceptual simplicity may mean mathematical complexity)They are also more likely to be accepted if they connect a wide range of phenomena",6
"Testing the consequences of a theory is part of the scientific methodPhysical theories can be grouped into three categories: mainstream theories, proposed theories and fringe theories    History    Theoretical physics began at least 2,300 years ago, under the Pre-socratic philosophy, and continued by Plato and Aristotle, whose views held sway for a millenniumDuring the rise of medieval universities, the only acknowledged intellectual disciplines were the seven liberal arts of the Trivium like grammar, logic, and rhetoric and of the Quadrivium like arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy",6
"During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the concept of experimental science, the counterpoint to theory, began with scholars such as Ibn al-Haytham and Francis BaconAs the Scientific Revolution gathered pace, the concepts of matter, energy, space, time and causality slowly began to acquire the form we know today, and other sciences spun off from the rubric of natural philosophyThus began the modern era of theory with the Copernican paradigm shift in astronomy, soon followed by Johannes Kepler's expressions for planetary orbits, which summarized the meticulous observations of Tycho Brahe; the works of these men (alongside Galileo's) can perhaps be considered to constitute the Scientific Revolution",6
"The great push toward the modern concept of explanation started with Galileo, one of the few physicists who was both a consummate theoretician and a great experimentalistThe analytic geometry and mechanics of Descartes were incorporated into the calculus and mechanics of Isaac Newton, another theoretician/experimentalist of the highest order, writing Principia MathematicaIn it contained a grand synthesis of the work of Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler; as well as Newton's theories of mechanics and gravitation, which held sway as worldviews until the early 20th century",6
"Simultaneously, progress was also made in optics (in particular colour theory and the ancient science of geometrical optics), courtesy of Newton, Descartes and the Dutchmen Snell and HuygensIn the 18th and 19th centuries Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Leonhard Euler and William Rowan Hamilton would extend the theory of classical mechanics considerablyThey picked up the interactive intertwining of mathematics and physics begun two millennia earlier by PythagorasAmong the great conceptual achievements of the 19th and 20th centuries were the consolidation of the idea of energy (as well as its global conservation) by the inclusion of heat, electricity and magnetism, and then light",6
"The laws of thermodynamics, and most importantly the introduction of the singular concept of entropy began to provide a macroscopic explanation for the properties of matterStatistical mechanics (followed by statistical physics and Quantum statistical mechanics) emerged as an offshoot of thermodynamics late in the 19th centuryAnother important event in the 19th century was the discovery of electromagnetic theory, unifying the previously separate phenomena of electricity, magnetism and lightThe pillars of modern physics, and perhaps the most revolutionary theories in the history of physics, have been relativity theory and quantum mechanics",6
"Newtonian mechanics was subsumed under special relativity and Newton's gravity was given a kinematic explanation by general relativityQuantum mechanics led to an understanding of blackbody radiation (which indeed, was an original motivation for the theory) and of anomalies in the specific heats of solids — and finally to an understanding of the internal structures of atoms and moleculesQuantum mechanics soon gave way to the formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), begun in the late 1920s",6
"In the aftermath of World War 2, more progress brought much renewed interest in QFT, which had since the early efforts, stagnated The same period also saw fresh attacks on the problems of superconductivity and phase transitions, as well as the first applications of QFT in the area of theoretical condensed matterThe 1960s and 70s saw the formulation of the Standard model of particle physics using QFT and progress in condensed matter physics (theoretical foundations of superconductivity and critical phenomena, among others), in parallel to the applications of relativity to problems in astronomy and cosmology respectively",6
"All of these achievements depended on the theoretical physics as a moving force both to suggest experiments and to consolidate results — often by ingenious application of existing mathematics, or, as in the case of Descartes and Newton (with Leibniz), by inventing new mathematicsFourier's studies of heat conduction led to a new branch of mathematics: infinite, orthogonal series.Modern theoretical physics attempts to unify theories and explain phenomena in further attempts to understand the Universe, from the cosmological to the elementary particle scale",6
"Where experimentation cannot be done, theoretical physics still tries to advance through the use of mathematical models    Mainstream theories   Mainstream theories (sometimes referred to as central theories) are the body of knowledge of both factual and scientific views and possess a usual scientific quality of the tests of repeatability, consistency with existing well-established science and experimentationThere do exist mainstream theories that are generally accepted theories based solely upon their effects explaining a wide variety of data, although the detection, explanation, and possible composition are subjects of debate",6
"    Examples       Proposed theories   The proposed theories of physics are usually relatively new theories which deal with the study of physics which include scientific approaches, means for determining the validity of models and new types of reasoning used to arrive at the theoryHowever, some proposed theories include theories that have been around for decades and have eluded methods of discovery and testingProposed theories can include fringe theories in the process of becoming established (and, sometimes, gaining wider acceptance)",6
"Proposed theories usually have not been testedIn addition to the theories like those listed below, there are also different interpretations of quantum mechanics, which may or may not be considered different theories since it is debatable whether they yield different predictions for physical experiments, even in principle    Examples       Fringe theories   Fringe theories include any new area of scientific endeavor in the process of becoming established and some proposed theoriesIt can include speculative sciences",6
"This includes physics fields and physical theories presented in accordance with known evidence, and a body of associated predictions have been made according to that theorySome fringe theories go on to become a widely accepted part of physicsOther fringe theories end up being disprovenSome fringe theories are a form of protoscience and others are a form of pseudoscienceThe falsification of the original theory sometimes leads to reformulation of the theory",6
"    Examples       Thought experiments vs real experiments    ""Thought"" experiments are situations created in one's mind, asking a question akin to ""suppose you are in this situation, assuming such is true, what would follow?""They are usually created to investigate phenomena that are not readily experienced in every-day situationsFamous examples of such thought experiments are Schrödinger's cat, the EPR thought experiment, simple illustrations of time dilation, and so onThese usually lead to real experiments designed to verify that the conclusion (and therefore the assumptions) of the thought experiments are correct",6

"In physics, work is the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacementIn its simplest form, it is often represented as the product of force and displacementA force is said to do positive work if (when applied) it has a component in the direction of the displacement of the point of applicationA force does negative work if it has a component opposite to the direction of the displacement at the point of application of the force.For example, when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped, the work done by the gravitational force on the ball as it falls is equal to the weight of the ball (a force) multiplied by the distance to the ground (a displacement)",6
"When the force F is constant and the angle between the force and the displacement s is θ, then the work done is given by:                          W                   F         s         cos         ⁡                    θ                          {\displaystyle W Fs\cos {\theta }}   Work is a scalar quantity, so it has only magnitude and no directionWork transfers energy from one place to another, or one form to anotherThe SI unit of work is the joule (J), the same unit as for energy",6
"    History   The ancient Greek understanding of physics was limited to the statics of simple machines (the balance of forces), and did not include dynamics or the concept of workDuring the Renaissance the dynamics of the Mechanical Powers, as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how far they could lift a load, in addition to the force they could apply, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work",6
"The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 in Le Meccaniche (On Mechanics), in which he showed the underlying mathematical similarity of the machines as force amplifiersHe was the first to explain that simple machines do not create energy, only transform it.According to Jammer, the term work was introduced in 1826 by the French mathematician Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis as ""weight lifted through a height"", which is based on the use of early steam engines to lift buckets of water out of flooded ore mines",6
"According to Rene Dugas, French engineer and historian, it is to Solomon of Caux ""that we owe the term work in the sense that it is used in mechanics now"" Although work was not formally used until 1826, similar concepts existed before then In 1759, John Smeaton described a quantity that he called ""power"" ""to signify the exertion of strength, gravitation, impulse, or pressure, as to produce motion.""  Smeaton continues that this quantity can be calculated if ""the weight raised is multiplied by the height to which it can be raised in a given time,"" making this definition remarkably similar to Coriolis'",6
"    Units   The SI unit of work is the joule (J), named after the 19th-century English physicist James Prescott Joule, which is defined as the work required to exert a force of one newton through a displacement of one metreThe dimensionally equivalent newton-metre (N⋅m) is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work, but this can be confused with the measurement unit of torqueUsage of N⋅m is discouraged by the SI authority, since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement, or a measurement of work.Non-SI units of work include the newton-metre, erg, the foot-pound, the foot-poundal, the kilowatt hour, the litre-atmosphere, and the horsepower-hour",6
" Due to work having the same physical dimension as heat, occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content, such as therm, BTU and calorie, are utilized as a measuring unit    Work and energy   The work W done by a constant force of magnitude F on a point that moves a displacement s in a straight line in the direction of the force is the product                         W                   F         s                         {\displaystyle W Fs.}   For example, if a force of 10 newtons (F   10 N) acts along a point that travels 2 metres (s   2 m), then W   Fs   (10 N) (2 m)   20 J",6
This is approximately the work done lifting a 1 kg object from ground level to over a person's head against the force of gravityThe work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distanceWork is closely related to energyThe work–energy principle states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a rigid body is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body,6
"Conversely, a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant forceThus, if the net work is positive, then the particle’s kinetic energy increases by the amount of the workIf the net work done is negative, then the particle’s kinetic energy decreases by the amount of work.From Newton's second law, it can be shown that work on a free (no fields), rigid (no internal degrees of freedom) body, is equal to the change in kinetic energy Ek corresponding to the linear velocity and angular velocity of that body,                         W                   Δ                    E                        k                             ",6
"                {\displaystyle W \Delta E_{k}.}   The work of forces generated by a potential function is known as potential energy and the forces are said to be conservativeTherefore, work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force field, without change in velocity or rotation, is equal to minus the change of potential energy Ep of the object,                         W                   −         Δ                    E                        p                                             {\displaystyle W -\Delta E_{p}.}   These formulas show that work is the energy associated with the action of a force, so work subsequently possesses the physical dimensions, and units, of energy",6
"The work/energy principles discussed here are identical to electric work/energy principles    Constraint forces   Constraint forces determine the object's displacement in the system, limiting it within a rangeFor example, in the case of a slope plus gravity, the object is stuck to the slope and, when attached to a taut string, it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any 'tauter'It eliminates all displacements in that direction, that is, the velocity in the direction of the constraint is limited to 0, so that the constraint forces do not perform work on the system",6
"For a mechanical system, constraint forces eliminate movement in directions that characterize the constraintThus the virtual work done by the forces of constraint is zero, a result which is only true if friction forces are excluded.Fixed, frictionless constraint forces do not perform work on the system, as the angle between the motion and the constraint forces is always 90°Examples of workless constraints are: rigid interconnections between particles, sliding motion on a frictionless surface, and rolling contact without slipping.For example, in a pulley system like the Atwood machine, the internal forces on the rope and at the supporting pulley do no work on the system",6
"Therefore, work need only be computed for the gravitational forces acting on the bodiesAnother example is the centripetal force exerted inwards by a string on a ball in uniform circular motion sideways constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the centre of the circleThis force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ballThe magnetic force on a charged particle is F   qv × B, where q is the charge, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field",6
"The result of a cross product is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors, so F ⊥ vThe dot product of two perpendicular vectors is always zero, so the work W   F ⋅ v   0, and the magnetic force does not do workIt can change the direction of motion but never change the speed    Mathematical calculation   For moving objects, the quantity of work/time (power) is integrated along the trajectory of the point of application of the force",6
"Thus, at any instant, the rate of the work done by a force (measured in joules/second, or watts) is the scalar product of the force (a vector), and the velocity vector of the point of applicationThis scalar product of force and velocity is known as instantaneous powerJust as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application.Work is the result of a force on a point that follows a curve X, with a velocity v, at each instant",6

"Thus, no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit (this is ideal, as all orbits are slightly elliptical)Also, no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force, such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge    Work done by a variable force   Calculating the work as ""force times straight path segment"" would only apply in the most simple of circumstances, as noted above",6
"If force is changing, or if the body is moving along a curved path, possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid, then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done, and only the component of the force parallel to the application point velocity is doing work (positive work when in the same direction, and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity)This component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called scalar tangential component (F cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the force and the velocity)",6
"And then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows:  Work of a force is the line integral of its scalar tangential component along the path of its application pointIf the force varies (e.gcompressing a spring) we need to use calculus to find the work done If the force is given by F(x) (a function of x) then the work done by the force along the x-axis from a to b is:                        W                              ∫                        a                                   b                                        F           (           s           )                  ⋅         d                    s                          {\displaystyle W \int _{a}^{b}\mathbf {F(s)} \cdot d\mathbf {s} }        Torque and rotation   A force couple results from equal and opposite forces, acting on two different points of a rigid body",6

The derivation of the work–energy principle begins with Newton’s second law of motion and the resultant force on a particle Computation of the scalar product of the forces with the velocity of the particle evaluates the instantaneous power added to the system.Constraints define the direction of movement of the particle by ensuring there is no component of velocity in the direction of the constraint forceThis also means the constraint forces do not add to the instantaneous power,6
"  The time integral of this scalar equation yields work from the instantaneous power, and kinetic energy from the scalar product of velocity and acceleration The fact that the work–energy principle eliminates the constraint forces underlies Lagrangian mechanics.This section focuses on the work–energy principle as it applies to particle dynamics In more general systems work can change the potential energy of a mechanical device, the thermal energy in a thermal system, or the electrical energy in an electrical device",6

"    Derivation for a particle in constrained movement   In particle dynamics, a formula equating work applied to a system to its change in kinetic energy is obtained as a first integral of Newton's second law of motion It is useful to notice that the resultant force used in Newton's laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle Remarkably, the work of a constraint force is zero, therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the work–energy principle",6
